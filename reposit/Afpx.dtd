<!-- Syntax and semantic of the descriptor file -->
<!-- ========================================== -->
<!-- Afpx_Descriptors allows defining the screen size for all descriptors -->
<!--  Default are a Height of 25 and a Width of 80. -->
<!-- The constants Screen.Width and Screen.Height are automatically created -->
<!--  as soon as the attribute is parsed (so it can be used for defining -->
<!--  the other attribute. The constants Screen.Up, Low, Left and Right -->
<!--  are also created. They are valid for all the descriptors. -->

<!-- The Afpx_Descriptors is made of several descriptors. -->
<!-- Before descriptors it is possible to re-define any of the 14 color. -->
<!--  The constants Color01 to Color14 are automatically created after this -->
<!--  definition or before the first descriptor. It is also possible to -->
<!--  define the default background for descriptors (default Color01). -->
<!-- Before descriptors, it is possible to define and overwrite variables. -->
<!-- These variables are valid for all the following descriptors. -->
