  -- Concept
  -- Several processes connect to a Bus on which they can publish messages.
  -- Each message is dispatched to observers, according to filters that they
  --  can set on the content of the messages.

  -- How to use:
  -- * First, create and initialise a Bus (provide an IPM address or LAN name,
  --    and a port num or name).
  --   Then you can send messages (strings) on the Bus.
  --   You can tune this Bus in the XML file indicated in the ENV variable
  --    AUTOBUS_CONFIG (see below).
  -- * Second, create an Observer (with a procedure Receive on it)
  --    and a Subscriber.
  --   Then init the Subscriber, possibly with a filter (regular expression) on
  --     the content of the expected messages.
  --    The procedure Receive will be called with the messages (received on the
  --     Bus) that match the filter.

  -- Implementation:
  -- Each Bus relies on a fixed IPM address and port, and a random TCP port.
  -- Each process sends periodically an IPM message with his host and TCP port.
  -- The other processes on the bus keep a list of known alive partners.
  -- When a new process starts it declares itself on the Bus and all the
  --  partners either connects to it or get connected to it.
  -- Delivering a message consists in sending it in TCP successively to the all
  --  the partners, each of them dispatching the message to the local observers.

  -- Tuning the Bus:
  -- A XML file allows the default tuning for all the Buses, and also a specific
  --  tuning for each Bus.
  -- For the default and also for each individual Bus:
  -- - Heartbeat_Period is the period in seconds at which each process on
  --    the Bus sends the alive message. It is used in combination with
  --    Heartbeat_Max_Missed. Default 1.
  -- - Heartbeat_Max_Missed, the number of missing alive messages after which
  --    the partners consider that a a process is dead (or at least unreachable)
  --    and discard it from the list of partners. Default 3.
  -- - Timeout for connecting and for sending each TCP message. When it fails
  --    the corresponding partner is discarded. Default 0.5.
  --    Note that the Timeout applies to each attempt of TCP connection. After
  --    each timeout there is a new attempt... likely until the partner is
  --    finally discarded because of alive timeout.
  -- - TTL for both IPM and TCP exchanges. Default 5.
  -- For each Bus, two ways to set a specific network interface for IPM and TCP:
  -- - Alias defines the IP address of the interface to be used by a given host.
  --    Ex: Name="telemaque" Address="192.168.0.5" means: if your local host
  --    name is telemaque then use the local interface with address 192.168.0.5
  -- - LAN defines the IP address and netmask of a LAN to use, if locally
  --    connected to the local host. Ex: Address="10.100.12.0"
  --    Netmask="255.255.255.0" means: if one of the local interfaces is
  --    10.100.12.*, then use this interface. A LAN directive will apply to all
  --    the hosts on the LAN, except for those which are previously defined
  --    in an Alias.
  -- Aliases and LANs are tested in the order of declaration. If none matches
  --  then the bus listens to, and sends the IPM messages on the interface
  --  associated to the local host name.
  -- See the DTD Autobus.dtd for the format of the XML file.

  -- Note that the exclusion of a partner (either because it informs that it
  --  dyes, or because of a timeout of alive message, or on timeout while
  --  connecting or sending) is not definitive. The partner is re-inserted when
  --  it is reachable again (i.e. when we receive an alive message from it). It
  --  only misses the applicative  messages that were sent meanwhile.
