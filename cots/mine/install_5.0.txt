Mine Detector is written entirely in Ada. You must have an Ada compiler to
build it
Mine Detector requires GtkAda (libre.act-europe.fr) and the PragmAda Reusable
Components (home.earthlink.net/~jrcarter010/pragmarc.htm). Currently GtkAda
requires the GNAT Ada compiler
The main procedure is Mine_Detector in file mine_detector.adb
Linux users may need to increase the value of Button_Size, in User_IF.First_Game
(file user_if.adb)

Using GNAT, build with the command

gnatmake -O2 -gnato mine_detector

Under Windows, the "-mwindows" linker argument may be added to eliminate the
DOS box:

gnatmake -O2 -gnato mine_detector -largs -mwindows
