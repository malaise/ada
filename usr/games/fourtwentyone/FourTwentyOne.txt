Four Twenty One (421)
=====================

This is a simulation of the dice game 421.

Presentation of the game
------------------------
The Four Twenty One game is popular and has many variants. This section presents
the variants and options that are implemented in this simulation.

Principles of the games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game is played by at least 2 players with 3 dices and 21 tokens.
It is decomposed into several sccessive sets, each made of two different steps:

- The 'load' step during which the tokens are dispatched from the kitty to the
players,
- The 'unload' step where the players try to give their tokens to the others.

When a player has no more token he stops playing the set. The looser of the
set is the player who has received all the tokens from the other players.

The first player who looses 2 sets looses the game and pays a penalty.

Dice combinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The tokens are exchanged among players according to the scores obtained with
the dices. The table below lists the combinations from the highest to the lowest
and indicates the value of each combination.

|==========================================================

Course of the set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The load
^^^^^^^^
.Who starts the load?

Each player throws one dice. The player with the lowest value (1 is lower than
6) starts the load.

.Course of a turn

The first player starts the turn. He throws the 3 dices and announces the
combination and the value, ex: "Ace two for two".

The player at his left throws the 3 dices. He announces the best combination and
the total so far for the turn, ex: "Ace three for five". And so on until all
players have thrown.

If two or more players have the same lowest combination this is a
xref:XRampo[rampo].

The player with the lowest combination receives from the kitty the total
amount of points cumulated during the turn, including the points obtained
during the xref:XRampo[rampo] if any. This marks the end of the turn and
this player starts the next turn.

.End of the load

The load step ends when the kitty is empty.

If a player has no token at all at the end of the load then he does not play the
next step (unload) and cannot loose the set. If a player has all the token at
the end of the load then he looses the set (the unload step is not played at
all).

The unload
^^^^^^^^^^
The load step ends and the unload starts when the kitty is empty.

.Start of the turn
The player who has got the last tokens from the kitty starts the first turn. He
throws the dices up to three times. After each throw he announces the
combination and the total so far for the turn, ex "Ace two for six".
The first player stops after the first, the second or the third throw, as he
wants. He announces the last combination, the number ot throws and the total
so far for the turn, ex: "Ace six in two for eight".

.Other players, number of throws
During the turn the remaining players try to make the highest combination in the
same number of throws as the first player. Before each throw, a player can
decide that he will stop after this throw (this is to be the last throw of his
go). He announces this decision, before throwing, by hitting the table with the
dices that he has in hand and that he will throw. +
After throwing, each player announces the curren combination and the total
so far for the turn. At the end of his go, if a player has obtained the best
combination, he announces it, taking into account the possibly new max number
of throws. ex:

* Player 1 throws 521 then 113 then 112, he announces "Five twenty one for
none", "Ace three for three" and "Ace two in three for five"
* Player 2 throws 123, announces "three two one for seven", hits and throws
114, and announces "Ace four in two for nine".

.Throwing and saving dices
After the first and after the second throw, a player can leave some dices on the
table and take the others for another throw. He can change his mind and
rethrow a dice that he previously left on the table. +
If a dice thrown hits a dice left on the table then the new value of the dice is
taken into account.

.Paying
At the end of the turn (including playing a xref:XRampo[rampo] for the highest
combination and a xref:XRampo[rampo] for the lowest combination) the player with
the highest combination gives to the one with the lowest the number of tokens
scored during the whole turn (or as many token as he has), including the
scores of the xref:XRampo[rampos]. +
The player who has lost this turn starts the new turn.

.End of the set
When a player has no more token, he is out of the set (and cannot loose it).
The looser of the set is the player who has collected all the token at the
end of the set.

The rampo
^^^^^^^^^
.When
anchor:XRampo[]The rampo is the situation where several players have the same
combination and when one must loose or win. This occurs when:

- several players have the same lowest combination during the load or during
the unload. The looser of the rampo will loose the turn.
- several players have the same highest combination during the unload. The
winner of the rampo will win the turn.

.Announces
Each time a player makes a combination in one of the situations above, he
announces "rampo". When each player has played his turn and if the rampo is
still significant for the turn, then the last rampo announces "hot hand" and
starts to play the rampo.
If there is a rampo for lowest and a rampo for highest scores,
then the lowest hot hand is announced and the corresponding rampo is played
before the hot hand and rampo for highest is played.

.Playing the rampo
The rampo is played like the load. Each player throws the dices once and
announces the combination and the total so far for the turn, except that the
players play in reverse order: The hot hand first, then the player at his right,
and so on.
There can be a new rampo within the rampo. It is announced as usual and
then played, back in the "normal" order, and so on.

Design of the software
----------------------
This section describes the objects that are implemented in the software and
their interactions.

The dices
~~~~~~~~~
It defines the dice_value (0 .. 6), effective_dice_value (1 .. 6)
and combination (3 effective_dice_values, private).

Operations:

- Return the value of a combination

- Compare 2 combinations (<, >, =, /=, <=, >=)

- Evaluate a combination.
 * Return Fourtwentyone, Triple, Aces, Suite, Nenette or Other.
 * Also return an effective dice value, (not significant for Fourtwentyone,
 Nenette and other). Ex 555 -> Triple 5, 114 -> Aces 4, 432 -> Suite 4
 * Return the sorted combination highest value first, then medium then lowest.

- Scan a combination: functions Has_A (effective_dice_value) and
+
Has (effective_dice_value, effective_dice_value)

The player
~~~~~~~~~~
It is created with a constant name and tag to indicate if it is human or
computer.

It has a number of set lost initialised to 0, a number of tokens and a tag
to indicate if he is playing the set.

It has an operation to receive some tokens and one to give some tokens to
another player.

During its go if has the dices (0, 1 or 3) to show, for each a boolean tag if
it is selected. Operations (un)select and "throw" to manipulate the dices.

After its go it has the result of the go (combination), with possible indication
of a rampo.

The players
~~~~~~~~~~~
It has the list of players.

The game
~~~~~~~~
It identifies the first player to start: It makes each player throw one dice and
idenfies the smallest value, handling a potential rampo. This identifies the
"previous looser"

It runs the sets one after the other, propagating the previous looser to
identify which starts, until it detects that the game is finished (one player
has lost 2 sets). The looser of the last set is the looser of the game.

The set
~~~~~~~
It initialises the kitty.

It starts the load with previous looser then the unload with the last looser of
the load.

It reports the looser of the set.

The load
~~~~~~~~
It starts the load turn with the looser of previous turn.
It takes tokens from the kitty and gives then to the looser of the load turn,
until the kitty is empty and reports the looser of the load.

.The load turn
It make the first player throw the dices and reports his combination as the
lowest, then the second player, up to the last player. It keeps the count of the
total value of the turn.

Then it calls the rampo checker for lowest combination, which returns the
looser of the turn. It reports the looser and the total.

The unload
~~~~~~~~~~
It starts the unload turn with the looser of previous turn.
It takes tokens from the winner of the unload turn and gives them to the looser
of the unload turn. It tags the players that have "won" and don't play any more
the set, until there is a looser for the set.

.The unload turn
It make the first player throw the dices up to 3 times, counts the points and
reports his combination as the lowest.
It makes the second player go and so on, up to the last player. It keeps the
count of the total value of the turn.

It calls the rampo checker for lowest combination, which returns the looser of
the turn. Then it calls the rampo checker for highest combination, which returns
the winner of the turn. It reports the winner, the looser and the total.

The rampo
~~~~~~~~~
It is called either for lowest or highest check and with the first player of the
turn.

It sets the direction to back.

loop::
It identifies the lowest/highest combination and searches if several players
have this same combination. If no, it returns the player with lowest/highest.
+
It tags these players as part of the rampo (untags the others).
+
From just before the first player of the turn and following the direction it
makes all players who are part of the rampo throw a dice.
It switches the direction and loops.

The table
~~~~~~~~~
This object hosts the graphical aspects. It has a function update to (re)draw
the current situation.

The computer
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This object implements the stateless strategy of the game.
There is a basic service that analyses a combination of 3

First player
^^^^^^^^^^^^
There is a specific algorithm for the first player, which takes only the number
of throws done so far and the current combination (3 dices).

It decides which dices to save/throw and it if this is the last.

.After the first and the second throw
- if there is a significant combination (not Other) not Aces stop now.
- if there are two aces
 * if the last dice is more that 3 stop now
 * else re-throw the last dice
- if there is 42, 41 or 21 keep it and throw last dice
- if there is one ace keep it and throw both other dices
- if there are 2 identical values keep them and throw last dice
- if there is 65, 54, 43, or 32 keep them and throw last dice
- else re-throw all dices

Other players
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The algorithm takes the combination to beat, the number of throws to do, the
number of throws done so far, the current combination (3 dices).

The strategy is the same as for the first player except that it must take into
account the target (combination and number of throws) and possibly decide to
stop before the target number of throws.

'TBD'

Possible improvements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The strategy could be improved by taking into account the number of players:
when more than two it is important to win but also important not to loose.
This may lead to take less risks (trying Aces before 421).

Another improvement would be to take into account the combinations obtained by
previous players.
