Master Mind
===========
V2.1

This is the classic "Master Mind" game, where the goal is to guess a secret
combination of colors, by successive tries and answers.

The secret is made of 3 to 5 pins among 8 colors. At each try you propose a
combination, and you get an answer of how many pins are correcty placed (same
color at the same location) and how many other pins are misplaced.

The official game exists in two variants:

- 'Clasic' with 4 columns and 10 rows (up to 10 tries),
- 'Super' with 5 columns and 12 rows.

In the present came you can choose from 3 to 5 columns and you have up to 12
tries to guess the secret. (If you want to limit to 10 tries you need to
apply it by yourself).

Presentation of the screen

.The menu,

game.

Above the menu is displayed a 'help' message on the possible actions in the
current context.

Above the help is a clock indicating the duration of the current game.

.The colors,
the column in the middle of the screen, is a read-only area allowing to pick a
color pin and to put it in a proposal.

on the left, is made of 12 rows, each filled progressively with color pins.
Once a row is complete, it is possible to submit the combination.

.The answers,
between the proposals and the colors, contains the answers to submitted
combinations. It can be either:

- "XXXX": The proposal is not complete or already answered previously, and it
cannot be answered),

- "????": The proposal is complete and can be answered,

- An answer: Some black and white pins, including no pin at all. It cannot be
modified.

How to play
-----------

Mainly, a round consists in filling a proposal then submitting it and getting
and answer. The proposals that have been answered cannont be modified any more.
On the other hand, any proposal can be filled and submited, providing that
it is not answered.

Filling a proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fill a proposal you can:

.Pick a color, from either:
- The colors area.

* Select a color here, then select a cell in an available (not answered)
proposal. The selected color will be copied into the destination cell,
overwriting its content if any.

* Double click on a color here. The color will be copied into the first
available cell (scanning from bottom left to top right).

- An answered proposal.

* Like from the colors area, select a cell and the color will be selected for
later copy into a target cell.

* Like from the colors area, double click on a cell and the color will be
copied into the first available cell.

- A not-answered proposal, including the one of the target cell. In this case
the pin will be *moved* from the selected cell into the target cell. +

.Remove a pin (clearing the cell)
by double clicking on it.

.Clear a full proposal (row)
by double clicking in the corresponding answer area when it shows "*XXXX*".
In this case the proposal is not complete or it has already been answered
previously, then it will be cleared.

NOTE: Beware that if the answer area shows "*????*", this means that the
proposal is complete and not already answered. Then it will be answered at first
click in the answer area (see below).

.Copy an answered proposal
by double clicking in the corresponding answer area (even empty) of an anwsered
proposal.  This will copy the answered proposal into the first empty proposal.

Submitting a proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once a proposal is complete, the corresponding answer area shows "*????*",
and a simple click in this answer triggers the submition.

If the selected proposal is not just above the last anwered, then it is
swapped with the one there, then answered.

End of the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game ends, and the secret combination becomes shown, when either:

.you find the secret combination
you submit a proposal and it matches.

.you fail
you submit all the 12 possible proposals without finding the secret.

.you give up
you click in "GIVE UP" menu.
