Klondike
========
V1.0

Klondike is a famous solitaire card game.

Goal of the game
----------------

Initially, 28 cards are randomly put on the table in 7 columns, 1 card in the
first (left) column, 2 cards in the second column... up to 7 cards in in the
seventh column. Only the last (top) card of each column is face up.

The 24 other cards are stacked face down in a dock (top left), from which they
can be pulled one by one.

The goal is to re-organise the cards and move them in crescent order into 4
sorted stacks (top right).

Playing areas
-------------

Playing stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main playing area is made of the 7 playing stacks.

In this area, only the the cards that are face up can be moved, and they are
stacked in decrescent order (King, Queen, Jack, 10 .. 2, Ace) and in alternate
colors (red / black). Several cards of a stack can be moved together in one
move. Only a King can be put in an empty stack.

When a card face down becomes the top of a stack (when the card(s) on top of it
have moved), then this card turns face up automatically.

Done stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~
This area contains 4 stacks, one for each suit, where the cards are stacked
in crescent order (Ace, 2 .. 10, Jack, Queen, King). Cards can be moved from
the paying area or from the dock, to these stacks. They can be moved back to
the paying area, providing that the stacking rules are respected.

Dock stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~
The Dock consists of two stacks, the Reserve stack, where the cards are face
down, and the Pull stack, where the cards are face up. Cards are moved one by
one from the Reserve stack to the Pull stack. The card at the top of the Pull
stack can be moved to a Play stack or a Done stack.

When the Reserve stack is empty, it is filled back with the content of the Pull
stack. This can be done only twice.

Menu
~~~~
.On the left side, the menu provides functions that abort the current game:

Exit::
This button stops and quits the game (the same way as the \'X' cross on the top-right
corner of the window depending on the window manager).

New::
This button stops the current game and starts a new one.

Start::
This button stops the current game and starts from scratch the game which number
has been entered in the field beside the button, or restarts the current game if
this number is invalid.

.On the right side are the functions that interact with the current game:

Purge::
This button moves in the Done stacks as many cards as possible. A purge can
also be triggered by a right click or a double left click on a Done stack.

Undo::
This button un-does one by one the previous card movements (potentially up
to the beginning of the current game).

Redo::
This button re-does one by one the un-done movements (potentially up to the
first un-done one).

NOTE: The movements, the Undo and Redo are completely reversible, except that
any explicit movement, while in a Undo/Redo sequence, completely resets the
history of the movements that can be un-done.

Detailed rules
--------------

How to play
~~~~~~~~~~~
A card is selected by a left-click then a release on it. Selectable cards are
identified by the mouse cursor becomming a hand when above them. Any card face
up, on top of a stack or somewhere within a valid sequence can be selected. A
card on top of a Done stack or on top of the the Pull stack can also be
selected.

Once a card is selected, its color becomes reversed, the cursor remains a hand,
denoting that it is time to select the destination (or to cancel the selection
by clicking again on the same card).

The destination can be:

* a Done stack, if the card is at the top of a Play stack, and if the target
card has the same color ans is immediately below the selected card.

* the top of another Play stack, if this makes a decrescent sequence with
alternate colors.

* an empty Play stack, if the selected card is a king.

Valid destinations are identified by becomming reversed when the cursor is
above them, and the mouse cursor becomes a down arrow. The destination is
validated by clicking then releasing on it.

The Dock stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As long as there are cards (face down) in the Reserve stack, then a left click
on the stack moves the top card, face up, to the Pull stack. When the
Reserve stack is empty, then a left click on the stack moves all the reamining
cards of the pull stack again face down in the Reserve stack.

The top card of the Pull stack can be selected and moved in the Play or the
Done area.

Moving to Done stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.Right click
A right click on a selectable card directly moves it to its Done stack if this
is valid.

.Double left click
A double left click on a selectable card acts as a right click (see above).

.Automatic purge
A double-left click or a right click on aDone stack tiggers an automatic purge
(as a click on the "Purge" button).

NOTE: A card of a suit can be used as relay for a card of another color.
In this case, the card is not purged. +
For example, a 4 of Club can be used as relay for a 3 of Heart or Diamond. But
this 3 will not need a relay if it can be Done (if its corresponding 2 is
already Done). As a consequence, the 4 of Club is purged if both the 2 of Heart
and the 2 of Diamond are already Done.

Multiple moves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within the play area it is possible to move several cards, providing that they
are face up, so they form a valid sequence of decrescent values and alternate
colors.

On the other hand, cards are moved one by one to and from the Done stacks, and
from the Pull stack.

Game number
-----------
Each game is identified by a number between 0 and 999999. The current game
number is displayed in the title of the main window.

Each 'New' game is a random one, and by default the first game is also random.
still, it is possible to specify as program argument the number of the first
game to start with. +
Also, it is possible to start a given game by entering the game number and then
clicking on the 'Start' button.
