Xwords
======
V1.1

Xwords is a graphical interface to the 'words' script, which searches in a
databse for words that match a pattern. Xwords also allows searching and listing
anagrams of a word.

General behavior
----------------
Xwords doesn't take any command line arguments, but requires several environment
variables to be set:

* WORDS_PATH: set to the directory where to find the script 'words' and
its files
* DICTIO_WORDS_FILE: set to the the path and name of the french common words
dabase
* DICTIO_NOUNS_FILE: set to the path and name of the french nounds database
* AFPX_DATA_DIR: (optional) set to the the directory of Afpx files for Xwords

The script 'xw' sets these variables before launching xwords.

Words modes
-----------
Words supports two modes: Search and Anagrams.

Search mode
~~~~~~~~~~~
In this mode, you can enter a pattern in the 'get' field (the field with white
background) and search with the button 'Search' the words that match this
pattern. In this mode, the pattern can contain '*' for any characters (none,
one or several), and '?' for any character once.

Alternataively, you can enter a regular expression pattern and search with the
button 'ReSearch'.

The list then shows the matching words. Common words are first listed in lower
case, then the nouns are listed in upper case.

The button 'Nouns' scrolls the list to the the first noun (if any).

.List management
The button 'history' lists the previous patterns on which a search has been
done. A double clic in one of them copies it in the 'get' field.

The button 'Clear' on the right clears the list (or error message).

.Actions on the get field
The button 'Recall' restores the pattern previously used for search.

The button 'Clear' on the top clears the 'get' field.

.Words database management
The buttons 'Add' and 'Del' allow adding or removing a common word or a noun.

Anagrams mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this mode, you can enter letters (not pattern) in the 'get' field, then
click on the 'Anagrams' button.

By default, the common words are listed, but you can tick the 'Nouns' button
before 'Anagrams', in order to search for anagrams in the nouns database.

The list shows the various words (sorted by decreasing length) that are
anagrams of the letters that you entered in the 'get' field.

You can then enter a pattern and search (or ReSearch) for words within these
anagrams.
