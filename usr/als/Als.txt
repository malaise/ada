Als
===
V23.0

Als lists files, directory contents... It supports several powerful options
for the selection of entries, for the output format of each entry, and general
formatting options.

General syntax
--------------

 Usage: als [ { <option> } ] [ { <file_or_dir_name> } ]
 or   : als -h | --help | -v | --version

List file or directory contents.

NOTE: The arguments '<file_or_dir_name>' must denote existing files or
directories. +
Wildcards are not supported for these arguments, but often the shell expands
the wildcards before providing the arguments to the program.  This is why,
for example, "als \*.xml" may work while "als \'\*.xml'" will fail. On this
respect 'als' behaves like 'ls'. +
Prefer the option '<match_name>' for specifying target names with wildcards. For
example, "als -m \'*.xml' subdir" will list the files with suffix 'xml' in
the subdirectory 'subdir'.

Other options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  -h (--help)                Show online help
  -v (--version)             Show current version of Als

Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The variable 'ALS_MAX_TO_SORT' can be set to define the number of entries above
which als does not apply the default sorting policy (alphanum) or the sorting
options. Set it to 0 for always sorting (1 leads to never sort). +
The default is 5000.

Notes on compatibility between options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Some options are ignored when alone
Some options are meaningful only when some other option is provided.
They are accepted and silently ignored when provided alone.

Example:

Option -H is useful only when -l is provided. So "als -H" is the same as "als".

.Some options are ignored when combined with some other options
Some options are meaningless when some other option is provided.
They are accepted and silently ignored in thses cases.

Example:

Many formating options ares meaningless when option -q is provided. So
"als -qlr" is the same as "als -q".

.Some options are mutually exclusive
Providing these options together is reported as an error.

Examples:

* Sorting criteria are mutually exclusive.
* -d and -n are mutually exclusive.
* -S is not compatible with some other formatting options (-l, -1 and -c).

.Some options are combined according to a specific logic

* Matching applies to the target of the link (if '--follow-links').
* Several matching criteria are usually combined with operator 'and', except
that:
 - several kinds are combined with 'or',
 - several name matching patterns or regex are combined with 'or'.

.Merge mode leads to specific outpout
This mode shows all (and only) the matching entries, one per row. For example,
when combined with the recursive mode, it does not show the directory names
as specific entries. +
By default it shows the full relative path of each entry when needed (implicit
-p), except if the "-b" or '-P' option is provided.

Criteria
~~~~~~~~
The criteria (provided for <match_name>, <exclude_name>, <match_dir>,
<exclude_dir> and <discard_dir>) follows the following syntax:

 * \'@<text>' considers '<text>' as a regular expression (possibly empty),
 * \'\@<text>' considers '@<text>' as a series of file templates, the first
template starting by "@",
 * \'\\@<text>' considers '\@<text>' as a series of file templates, the first
template starting by "\@", +
...

 * other \'<text>' is considered as templates (possibly empty),
'<template>,<template>...'.

Also beware that template matching function considers the character \'\' as an
escape character, so "\x" in the template matches the character \'x' in the
file, whatever \'x', including the character \'\'.

Examples:

  "toto"    will match "@t.t."        (regex "t.t.")
  "@toto"   will match "\@toto"       (patern "@toto",     checks "@toto")
  "@toto"   will match "\\@toto"      (patern "\@toto",    checks "@toto")
  "\@toto"  will match "\\\@toto"     (patern "\\@toto",   checks "\@toto")
  "\@toto"  will match "\\\\@toto"    (patern "\\\@toto",  checks "\@toto"))
  "\\@toto" will match "\\\\\@toto"   (patern "\\\\@toto", checks "\\@toto"))
  "\toto"   will match "\\toto"       (pattern "\\toto",   checks "\toto"))
  "\toto"   will match "\\\toto"      (pattern "\\\toto",  checks "\toto"))
  "\\toto"  will match "\\\\toto"     (pattern "\\\\toto", checks "\\toto"))

Name matching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The general rule is that, if at least one matching criteria is provided, then
the name (wthout path) must match at least one of them. No criteria means
"all names match". +
Conversely, if at least one exclusion criteria is provided, then
the name must not match any of them. No criteria means "all names
match" as well.

The matching of directory name in recursive mode is handled a specific way.
If the current directory name matches a 'discard-dir' criteria, then
its content *and* subdirectories are skipped, otherwise:

* If the current directory name matches a 'exclude-dir' criteria (if there are
some), or if it does not match any 'match-dir' criteria (if there are some),
then the content of the directory is skipped but its subdirectories are scanned.

* If the name matches a 'match-dir' criteria (or if there is none)
and does not match any 'exclude-dir' criteria (or if there is none), then the
content of the directory is listed and the subdirectories are scanned.

Access rights
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The general syntax for specifying the access rights is:

  --access=rwx

where any of the three letters \'r', \'w' and \'x' can be replaced by \'-' or
\'*'.  +

 * 'r' means that the entry must be readable
 * 'w' means that the entry must be writable
 * 'x' means that the entry must be executable
 * '-' instead of a letter means that the entry must not have the corresponding
access right
 * '*' instead of a letter means that the entry can have or can not have the
corresponding access right

So the default mode (no criteria) corresponds to: '--access=\***', the list of
read-only items is specified with '--access=r--' and the list of readable and
executable items is specified with '--access=r*x'.

Date criteria
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These criteria allow selecting the entries based on the modification time.

.One date
When one criteria is set, it defines a comparison operator and a date or a
duration. +
The date specifies the year, month... minutes and seconds. A partial date
without time stands for 00:00:00, and a partial date with only a time stands for
the current day.

.Two dates
Two creteria can be combined (one being 'less' and the other 'greater') in
order to select files within a given time slice.

.Newer
The 'newer' criteria can be used as a shortcut for "'date ge'". It can be
combined with a second date criteria ('lt' or 'le').

Symbolic links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.Links and broken links
Option -L leads als to select all the symbolic links. +
Option -B leads als to list only the broken links, i.e. the one for which the
final target (possibly following recursive links) cannot be read.

.Following links
When --follow-links option is set and in recursive mode, if the target of a
symbolic link is a directory, then this directory is added to the scan. +

.Showing target of links
When --show-targets is set, then als shows (when -l) the final target and its
size, instead of the initial target of the symbolic links.

NOTE: The options --follow-links and --show-targets are not used for assessing
if a link is valid or broken (in any case, the link is valid only if the final
target exists and is readable).

.Detailed list
With option -l, the target of valid links is preceeded by '->', while the
target of broken link is preceeded by '=>'. With option --show-targets the
target that is shown is the one on which the reading error occured.

Als exit codes
--------------
Als exits with 0 if a file or dir has been shown, with 1 otherwise and with 2
on error.
