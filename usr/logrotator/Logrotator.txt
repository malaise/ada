Logrotator
=========
V2.4

Logrotator reads an input flow of text lines (e.g. logs) and splits it into
several files according to various rules. +
The main driver for splitting files is a period. Within a period, one or
several files of a fixed size are created.

Usage
-----

Logrotator takes as argument a root file name and, as option:

* a period (min 1s, no max, default 1 day)
* a maximum number of periods (min 1, max 999, default 7)
* a maximum file size (min 1, no max, default none)
* a maximum number of files per period (min 1, max 999, default 999)

Usage: logrotator [ <period> ] [ <cycle> ] [ <file_size> ] [ <files> ] <file_name>
<period>    ::= -p <duration> | --period=<duration>  // Period of cycle
<duration>  ::= <number> s | h | d                   // Time in seconds, hours or days
<cycle>     ::= -c <number> | --cycle=<number>       // Max number of periods
<file_size> ::= -s <size> | --size=<size>            // Max file size
<size>      ::= <number> [ k | M | G ]               // Size in bytes, kilos, Megas or Gigas
<files>     ::= -f <number> | --files=<number>       // Max files per period

Example:
.........................................
logrotator -p 1d -c 10 -s 2.5M -f 21 logfile < pipe

Behaviour
---------

Logrotator reads its standard input and creates successively, in its current
directory, several output files named <file_name>_xxx.yyy. +
xxx is from 000 up to the cycle (the max number of periods) excluded and is
incremented each time the period is reached. When the cycle is reached
then a warning is emitted and xxx restarts from 000, overwritting previous
files.

yyy is from 000 to 999 and restarts from 000 each time xxx is incremented.
Within a period, if the maximum file size is reached (if set), then logrotator
increments yyy and switches to a new file. If the max number of files is
reached, then a warning is emitted and yyy restarts from 000, overwritting
previous files. +
Each time a new period xxx is started, the files of the previous
occurence of this period (xxx.\***) are cleared.

NOTE: Logrotator does not split the lines of input text, so each line longer
than <file_size> will lead to a file containing this line.
