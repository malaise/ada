Logrotator
=========
V1.1

Logrotator reads an input flow of text lines (e.g. logs) and splits it into
several files according to various rules.

Usage
----

Logrotator takes as argument a root file name and, as option

* a period (min 1s, no max, default 1 day)
* a maximum number of periods (min 1, no max, default 9) 
* a maximum file size (min 1, no max, default none).
.........................................
Usage: logrotator [ <period> ] [ <cycle> ] [ <size> ] <file_name>
<period>   ::= -p | --period <duration>
<duration> ::= <number> s | h | d               // seconds, hours or days
<cycle>    ::= -c | --cycle <number>            // number of periods
<size>     ::= -s | --size  <number> [ k | M ]  // Size in bytes, kilos or Megas
.........................................

Logrotator reads its standard input and creates successively, in its current
directory, several output files named <file_name>_xxx.yyy. +
xxx is from 000 up to the max number of periods (excluded) and is incremented
each time the period is reached. +
yyy is from 000 to 999 and restarts from 000 each time xxx is incremented.
Within a period, if the maximum size is reached (if set), then logrotator
increments yyy and switches to a new file. If 999 is reached then a warning is
emitted and the xxx.000 file is overwritten.
