Strategy for automatic enigma setting considering the date.
Usage: def_enigma [ -text ] [ <date> | rnd | <text_key> ]
  date ::= dd/mm/YYyy

If rnd, generates a random switch sequence, 3 to 4 rotors (see B.).
reflector (A to Cthin).
If date, generates a switch sequence, 3 rotors and the reflector from the date.
If no arg, same with current date.
If -text, generates text of key (see C.).
If text_key, displays the key from text jey (see C.).

Rotors (at least 10) and reflectors (at least 5) are defined in enigma.xml.

A. Normal generation
The date is either provided or is current date.
The date that is considered is DAYNAME DAYNUM MONTHNAME.
1. Switches
The switches definition is got from the letters of DAYNAME and MONTHNAME, with
criteria of unicity, no identity and even number (and max 26 letters).
Ex MONDAY DECEMBER -> MONDAYECBR.

2. Reflector
The Reflector is fixed (B). Its offset is computed from the daynum:
01->A, 02->B .. 26->Z, 27->A, 28->B, 29->C, 30->D, 31->E.

3. Rotors
There are 3 rotors:
- The first rotor number is the unit of DAYNUM, with 1->1 .. 10->10, 11->1.
- The second rotor is the tenth of DAYNUM, with 0..9->1, 10..19->2,
20..29->3 and 30..31 ->4. If used by first rotor, then add 1.
- The third rotor is month num rem 10 with 1->1 .. 10->10, 11->1...
If used by first or second rotor, then add 1.
The rotor (ring) carry offsets are the first three letters of DAYNAME
respectively.
The rotor initial offsets are the first three letters of MONTHNAME respectively.

4. Output format
The optional switche are -s{<letter><letter>}
The optional setting of rotos is -r <rotor>#<rotor>....
  where each <rotor> is <rotor_name>@<ring_offset>
The reflector setting is <reflector_name><reflector_offset>
The initial rotors positions are -i{<letter>} with as may letter as rotors
number.
Ex: -sTPWASFXIEVZCYLBN -rI@G#IV@C#VII@Q#II@G Cthin@B -iTLDO


B. Random generation
The switch is a random list (1 to 12 included) of random pairs of letters
The refelctor is random from 1 to 5 included
The rotors are a random number (3 to 4 included) of random rotors (1 to 10),
each with random carry-offset letter and a random initial offset letter.


C. Text output
If optionnal -text is provided, the key (random, from current date or from
provided date) is translated to text:
The switch definition is displayed, followed by JJJ (letter cannot appear
twice at first of pair, nor twice as second of pair, in switch definition).
Then the rotors are displayed but their number in letters instead of name,
each with the ring carry then the initial offset.
Then the reflector num in letters and its offset.
Then the reflector offset is repeated (so that, like a rotor, it is a number
in letters then two letters), then the reflector number is repeated another
time (a rotor num cannot appear twice, so this marks the end). Example
-rV@M#III@O#I@N B@Y -iJAN -> MONDAYJUJJJFIVEMJTHREEOAONENNTWOYYTWO

If the key is provided as text, then it is transformed into normal opions.
