Strategy for automatic enigma setting considering the date.
Usage: def_enigma [ -text ] [ <date> | rnd | <text_key> ]
  date ::= dd/mm/YYyy

If rnd, generates a random switch sequence, 3 to 8 jammers and a back from 7
to 9.
If date, generates a switch sequence, 3 jammers and the back from the date.
If no arg, same with current date.
If -text, generate text of key (see B.)
If text_key, display key from text jey (see B.)

A. Normal generation
The date that is considered is DAYNAME DAYNUM MONTHNAME.
1. Switch
The switch definition is got from the letters of DAYNAME and MONTHNAME, with
criteria of unicity and even number. Ex MONDAY DECEMBER -> MONDAYECBR.

2. Back
The back scambler number is fixed (8) . Its offset is computed from the daynum:
01->A, 02->B .. 26->Z, 27->A, 28->B, 29->C, 30->D, 31->E.

3. Jammers
There are 3 jammers:
- The first jammer number is the unit of DAYNUM, with 9->0, + 1.
9,0->1, 1->2, 3->3 .. 9->9.  Ex, the 13th->3, 19th->9.
If this leads to 8 (already used for the back) then use 9.
- The second is the month num / 10, with 9->0, + 1.
Jan .. Aug->1, Sep->1 and Oct .. Dec->2. If used by first jammer, then add 1.
- The thrid jammers is month num rem 10 with 9->0, + 1.
Jan->2, Feb->3 .. Aug->9, Sep->1, Oct->1, Nov->2, Dec->3. If used by back,
first or second jammer, then add 1. Ex Sep will not be 1 because 1 is already
used by jammer 2. Sep becomes 2 (if not used by 1st jammer).
The jammers offsets are the first three letters of MONTHNAME respectively.
The jammers carry offsets are the first three letters of DAYNAME
respectively.

B. Letters
If optionnal -text is provided, the key (random, from current or from provided
date) is translated to text:
The switch definition is displayed, followed by JJJ (letter cannot appear
twice at first nor twice as second in switch).
Then the jammers and back are displayed but with letters instead of numbers:
1AF2BP -> ONEAFTWOBP. Then the back offset is repeated (so that, like a jammer,
it is a number then two letters), then the back number is repeated another time
(a scrambler num cannot appear twice, so this marks the end).

If the key is provided as text, then it is transformed into normal opions.
