Strategy for automatic enigma setting considering the date.
Usage: def_enigma [ -text ] [ <date> | rnd | <text_key> ]
  date ::= dd/mm/YYyy

If rnd, generates a random switch sequence, 3 to 8 jammers and a back from 7
to 9.
If date, generates a switch sequence, 3 jammers and the back from the date.
If no arg, same with current date.
If -text, generates text of key (see B.)
If text_key, displays the key from text jey (see B.)

Jammers (1 to 9) are defined in enigma.cnf.  Only jammmers 7 to 9 are symetric
and can be used as back.

A. Normal generation
The date is either provided or is current date.
The date that is considered is DAYNAME DAYNUM MONTHNAME.
1. Switch
The switch definition is got from the letters of DAYNAME and MONTHNAME, with
criteria of unicity and even number. Ex MONDAY DECEMBER -> MONDAYECBR.

2. Back
The back scambler number is fixed (8). Its offset is computed from the daynum:
01->A, 02->B .. 26->Z, 27->A, 28->B, 29->C, 30->D, 31->E.

3. Jammers
There are 3 jammers:
- The first jammer number is the unit of DAYNUM, with 9->0, + 1.
9,0->1, 1->2, 3->3 .. 8->8.  Ex, the 13th->4, 19th->1.
If this leads to 8 (already used for the back) then use 9.
- The second is the month num / 10, with 9->0, + 1.
Jan .. Aug->1, Sep->1 and Oct .. Dec->2. If used by first jammer, then add 1.
- The third jammers is month num rem 10 with 9->0, + 1.
Jan->2, Feb->3 .. Aug->9, Sep->1, Oct->1, Nov->2, Dec->3. If used by back,
first or second jammer, then add 1. Ex Sep will not be 1 because 1 is already
used by jammer 2. Sep becomes 2 (if not used by 1st jammer).
The jammers offsets are the first three letters of MONTHNAME respectively.
The jammers carry offsets are the first three letters of DAYNAME
respectively.

B. Letters
If optionnal -text is provided, the key (random, from current date or from
provided date) is translated to text:
The switch definition is displayed, followed by JJJ (letter cannot appear
twice at first of pair, nor twice as second of pair, in switch definition).
Then the jammers and back are displayed but with letters instead of numbers:
1AF2BP -> ONEAFTWOBP. Then the back offset is repeated (so that, like a jammer,
it is a number then two letters), then the back number is repeated another time
(a scrambler num cannot appear twice, so this marks the end).

If the key is provided as text, then it is transformed into normal opions.

C. Random generation
The switch is a random list (0 to 13 included) of random pairs of letters
The back is a random jammer from 7 to 9 included
The jammers are a random number (3 to 8 included) of random jammers (1 to 9),
each with random carry-offset letter and a random offset letter.
