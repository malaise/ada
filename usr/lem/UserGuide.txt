                            Land LEM  V2.1

1. Presentation
The goal of the game is to land the LEM safely on the Moon.
The LEM must touch the ground in a flat area, with reasonable horizontal and
vertical speeds, then stop its engines.
Normal mode defines at least one large flat area, hard mode (argument -h)
defines at least one narrow flat area.

2. The screen
The main area represents the space, the LEM and the ground.
The LEM must not reach the borders (up, left or right) of the space, otherwise
it is lost. The ground shows at least one flat landing area.
Around the space are the gauges. On the right, the vertical thrust and the
vertical speed. At the bottom, the remaining fuel and the horizontal speed.
The fuel gauge becomes red when reaching 20%.
The speeds are red when above acceptable values for landing. Note that the LEM
speed can be far above the speed gauges maxima without problem.
Finally, in the lower right corner, an indicator shows "APP" when close above a
landing area and "LAND" when landed.

3. Commands
When flying and landed, the commands are the four arrows. Each arrow activates
the corresponding engine.
Vertical arrows increase/decrease vertical thrust by a tenth each time. Down
arrow increases thrust and up arrow reduces it.
Horizontal arrows apply an horizontal thrust for one second. Left arrow
activates left engine, thus increasing speed to the right. Right arrow
activates activates right engine, thus increasing speed to the left.

4. Playing
The game starts at a random (high) position, with a random vertical speed and
a reasonable vertical thrust. First adjust vertical thrust to get a reasonable
descending speed.
Then spot a flat landing area and adjust horizontal speed to reach it.
When approaching, reduce speeds, remain above the landing site (APP indicator)
with acceptable speeds (not red).
Reduce the vertical thrust when (or just before) contacting the ground.
When landed (LAND indicator), horizontal thrust has no effect.
You can use the horizontal thrust to take off, or shut-down the engine and end
the game.
You can then hit any key (except an arrow and escape) to start a new game.
At any time, hitting escape aborts the game and quits.
