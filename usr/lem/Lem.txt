Land LEM
========
V3.0
:toc:

The goal of the game is to land the LEM on the Moon.

The LEM must touch the ground in a flat area, with reasonable horizontal and
vertical speeds, then stop its engines.

Presentation of the screen
--------------------------

image:Lem.png["Lem",title="Lem"]

The space
~~~~~~~~~
The main area represents the space, the LEM and the Moon ground.

The LEM must not reach the borders (up, left or right) of the space, otherwise
it is lost. The ground shows at least one flat landing area.

The gauges
~~~~~~~~~~
Around the space are the gauges: on the right, the vertical thrust and the
vertical speed, and at the bottom, the remaining fuel and the horizontal
speed.

The fuel gauge becomes yellow when reaching 20%, then red when reaching 10%.
The speeds are red when above acceptable values for landing. Note that the LEM
speed can be far above the speed gauges maxima without problem.

Finally, in the lower right corner, an indicator shows "APPR" when above a
landing area and and not too high (less than 5 times the LEM height).

This indicator shows "CLOSE" when getting close to land, then "LAND" when
landed.

Below the indicator, a chronometer indicates the duration of the mission.

Arguments of the program
-------------------------
When started with argument "-h" the game is harder because the the landing area
is thinner.

When started with argument "-g" the mouse pointer is grabbed in the game
window. It can be grabed / ungrabed at any time by pressing the key ''g''.

Commands of the game
--------------------
Hit ''g'' at any time to grab or ungrab the mouse pointer in the window (while
within the window the pointer is hidden).

Hit space while flying to pause or resume the game.

When flying and landed, the commands are the four arrows. Each arrow activates
the corresponding engine.

Vertical arrows increase/decrease vertical thrust by 15% each time. Down
arrow increases thrust and up arrow reduces it.

Control + down arrow applies full thrust and Control + up arrow shuts down the
engine.

Horizontal arrows apply an horizontal thrust for one second. Left arrow
activates left engine, thus increasing speed to the right. Right arrow
activates activates right engine, thus increasing speed to the left.

Control + an horizontal arrow applies a thrust 5 times higher than normal
arrow (still for one second).

Mouse controls can also be used: left and right click and double click for
horizontal thrust, and wheel for vertical thurst.

Playing the game
----------------
Scenario
~~~~~~~~
The game starts at a random (high) position, with a random vertical speed and
a reasonable vertical thrust (and a very reasonable horizontal speed).
Spot a flat landing area and adjust speeds to reach it. Check the area (APPR
indicator) before landing.

You land safely if within 75% of the speed limits and with at least 10% of
fuel remaining. Otherwise it is just acceptable (normally, below average).

When landed (LAND indicator), horizontal thrust has no effect. You can still
use the vertical thrust to take off, or you can shut-down the engine, which
ends the game.

When the game ends, a message indicates if you lost or crashed the LEM, if you
landed normally or safely.

You can then hit any key (except an arrow) or click middle button to play
again.

If you landed, then you start a new game, otherwise you restart the same game.

If you landed, you can hit Control Tab to restart the same game.

At any time, hitting escape aborts the game and quits.

Weight dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The quantity of fuel affects the global mass so the effectiveness of thrust
increases when fuel dicreases. On the long term, the LEM tends to climb (or
fall slower) and each horzontal thrust burst affects horizontal speed more
and more.

The fuel decreases proportionnaly with the vertical thrust and at each burst
of horizontal thrust.

Hints
~~~~~
Try to always descend: quickly fix vertical rate then spot a landing area and
move horizontally, fast if needed (more than the gauge limit). Visualise the
trajectory, anticipate the approach (what you see is speed, what you change is
acceleration).

Beware that the horizontal speed is nearly never nul, if needed, swap sides
when getting close to a side of the landing area. Also anticipate the changes
of vertical speeds, always remain on the "safe" side.

You will bump (APPR then LAND then APPR) if you are slowing down at excessive
rate (positive acceleration). The best landing is with a null or slightly
negative acceleration. So, at the last time, reduce a littel bit the power (if
it is safe).

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any software has bugs. Please report any bug to malaise-at-magic-dot-fr.

If you think that you landed properly but crashed, please check the speeds and
the "APPR" indicator before suspecting a bug. If the speeds are not both blue
or the "LAND" indicator is not set at the time the LEM contacts the ground,
then it is a crash, not a bug.

Elements of design
------------------

The axes are x (horizontal, left to right) and y (vertical bottom to top).

  y ^
    |
    |
    +----> x

The LEM
~~~~~~~
Is square 10x10 m made of a rectangle and 2 feet and has an empty mass of M kg.

It has a fuel tank of F kg of fuel.

  +-----+
  | LEM |
  +-----+
  /     \

It provides the following operations

- Set_X_Thrust and Set_Y_Thrust (Y_Thrust)
  * Max_X_Thrust is applied during a fixed delay
  * Max_Y_Thrust < Y_Thrust <= 0 in N (1N = 1kg.m/s^2^) as long as there
    is fuel in the tank

- Get_Speed returning a speed vector (on X and Y)

- Get_Position returning a position (in X and Y)

The acceleration a is X_Thrust / m and Y_Thrust / m + g

The mass m is m0 - (X_Thrust + Y_Thrust) * C * t

Where C is the consumption rate in kg/N/s

Each period, V0, P0, m0 and a are re-computed with current thrust value
(which leads to a rather accurate integration of mass evolution).

Speed V = V0 + a.t and position P = 1/2.a.t^2^ + VO.t + P0

where t is the delta from prev second

The initial situation of the LEM is:

- height  Hmax - 10

- an initial Y thrust Y_Thrust_Init

- an initial vertical speed, random and small negative (> Min_Init_Speed)

- a tank full, which leads to an intial mass M + F

The moon
~~~~~~~~
It has a constant gravity g.

It generates a random ground, width (250m) made of several (18) points, so that
the delta between points (14m) > width of LEM (10m).

Points are at random height from Hpmin (2m) to Hpmax (50m). One random point
has its pred and succ forced at the same height => the landing site (28m). In
hard mode only the pred is forced to the landing height, so the area is thiner
(14m). The landing site is not at the border (right or left) of the space.

The space
~~~~~~~~~
Checks the status of the LEM (flying, landed, crashed) each second.

- flying as long as the LEM square (10x10) does not interfere with the
ground. Check the feet, both lower corners of the square.

- if ground between feet is flat, and Max_Land_Yspeed < Yspeed \<= 0 and |
Xspeed | \<= Max_Land_Xspeed \=> landed

- else crashed

The screen
~~~~~~~~~~
Initialises displaying the ground and the LEM at init position.

Displays the LEM each 1/10s

Displays the Y thrust, Y speed and X speed current values each 0.5s

The inputs
~~~~~~~~~~
<- and -> set a X thrust to Max_X_Thrust during 1s

&#8595; and &#8593; increase/decrease Y thrust by 1/5 of Max_Y_Thrust

Values
~~~~~~

Fuel F=5.600 tons

Empty mass M=10 tons

Max_Y_Thrust=44 kN

Max_X_Thrust=4 kN

Consumption rate C=1.83x10^-3^ kg/N/s

Width=500 m

Hmax=200 m

Hpmax=50 m

Validation
~~~~~~~~~~
.In theory,
without decreasing the mass (and without X thrust):

[width="75%", options="header"]
|=========================================================
|                   |Full mass           |Empty mass
|Mass (kg)          | M + F = 15600      |M = 10000
|Weight (N)         | 15600 * g = 25506  |16350
|Consumption (kg/s) | 25506 * C = 46.68  |29.92
|Autonomy (s)       | 5600 / 46.68 = 120 |187
|=========================================================

.Practically,
starting at full mass and applying a (decreasing) Y thrust to remain at constant
height the mission duration is around 150s.
