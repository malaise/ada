Land the LEM
============
V3.1

The goal of the game is to land the LEM on the Moon.

The LEM must touch the ground in a flat area, with reasonable horizontal and
vertical speeds, then stop its engines.

Presentation of the screen
--------------------------

The space
~~~~~~~~~
The main area represents the space, the LEM and the Moon ground.

The LEM must not reach the borders (up, left or right) of the space, otherwise
it is lost. The ground shows at least one flat landing area.

The gauges
~~~~~~~~~~
Around the space are the gauges: on the right, the vertical thrust and the
vertical speed, and at the bottom, the remaining fuel and the horizontal
speed.

The fuel gauge becomes yellow when reaching 20%, then red when reaching 10%.
The speeds are red when above acceptable values for landing. Note that the LEM
speed can be far above the speed gauges maxima without problem.

Finally, in the lower right corner, a "LAND" indicator shows 'APPR' when above a
landing area and and not too high (less than 5 times the LEM height). +
This indicator shows 'CLOSE' when getting close to land, then 'LAND' when
landed.

Below the indicator, a chronometer indicates the duration of the mission.

Arguments of the program
-------------------------
When started with argument "-h" or --hard the game is harder because the landing
area is thinner.

When started with argument "-g" or --grab the mouse pointer is grabbed in the
game window. It can be grabbed / un-grabbed at any time by pressing the
key ''g''.

Option --help displays a summary of possible arguments. All other arguments
are ignored.

Commands of the game
--------------------
Hit ''g'' at any time to grab or un-grab the mouse pointer in the window (while
within the window the pointer is hidden).

Hit space while flying to pause or resume the game.

When flying and landed, the commands are the four arrows. Each arrow activates
the corresponding engine.

Vertical arrows increase/decrease vertical thrust by 15% each time. Down
arrow increases thrust and up arrow reduces it.

Control + down arrow applies full thrust and Control + up arrow shuts down the
engine.

Horizontal arrows apply an horizontal thrust for one second. Left arrow
activates left engine, thus increasing speed to the right. Right arrow
activates right engine, thus increasing speed to the left.

Control + an horizontal arrow applies a thrust 5 times higher than normal
arrow (still for one second).

Mouse controls can also be used: left and right click and double click for
horizontal thrust, and wheel for vertical thrust.

Playing the game
----------------
Scenario
~~~~~~~~
The game starts at a random (high) position, with a random vertical speed and
a reasonable vertical thrust (and a very reasonable horizontal speed).
Spot a flat landing area and adjust speeds to reach it. Check the area ("LAND"
indicator showing 'APPR' or 'CLOSE') before landing.

You land safely if within 75% of the speed limits and with at least 10% of
fuel remaining. Otherwise it is just acceptable (normally, below average).

When landed ("LAND" indicator showing 'LAND'), horizontal thrust has no effect.
You can still use the vertical thrust to take off, or you can shut-down the
engine (by setting vertical thrust to 0), which ends the game.

When the game ends, a message indicates if you lost or crashed the LEM, if you
landed normally or safely.

You can then hit any key (except an arrow) or click middle button to play
again.

If you landed, then you start a new game, otherwise you restart the same game.

If you landed, you can hit Control Tab to restart the same game.

At any time, hitting escape aborts the game and quits.

Weight dynamics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The quantity of fuel affects the global mass so the effectiveness of thrust
increases when fuel decreases. On the long term, the LEM tends to climb (or
fall slower) and each horizontal thrust burst affects horizontal speed more
and more.

The fuel decreases proportionaly with the vertical thrust and at each burst
of horizontal thrust.

Hints
~~~~~
Try to always descend: quickly fix vertical rate then spot a landing area and
move horizontally, fast if needed (more than the gauge limit). Visualize the
trajectory, anticipate the approach (what you see is speed, what you change is
acceleration).

Beware that the horizontal speed is nearly never null, if needed, swap sides
when getting close to a side of the landing area. Also anticipate the changes
of vertical speeds, always remain on the "safe" side.

You will bump ('APPR' then 'LAND' then 'APPR') if you are slowing down at excessive
rate (positive acceleration). The best landing is with a null or slightly
negative acceleration. So, at the last time, reduce a little bit the power (if
it is safe).

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you think that you landed properly but crashed, please check the speeds and
the "LAND" indicator before suspecting a bug. If the speeds are not both blue
or the "LAND" indicator is empty at the time the LEM contacts the ground,
then it is a crash, not a bug :-).

Elements of design
------------------

The axes are x (horizontal, left to right) and y (vertical bottom to top).

The LEM
~~~~~~~
The LEM is a square 10x10 m made of a rectangle and 2 feet and has an empty
mass of M kg.

It has a fuel tank of F kg of fuel.

  +-----+
  | LEM |
  +-----+
  /     \

It provides the following operations

- Set_X_Thrust and Set_Y_Thrust (Y_Thrust)
  * Max_X_Thrust is applied during a fixed delay
  * Max_Y_Thrust < Y_Thrust <= 0 in N (1N = 1kg.m/s^2^) as long as there
    is fuel in the tank

- Get_Speed returning a speed vector (on X and Y)

- Get_Position returning a position (in X and Y)

The acceleration a is X_Thrust / m and Y_Thrust / m + g

The mass M is M0 - (X_Thrust + Y_Thrust) * C * t

Where C is the consumption rate in kg/N/s

Each period, V0, P0, M0 and a are re-computed with current thrust value
(which leads to a rather accurate integration of mass evolution).

Speed V = V0 + a.t and position P = 1/2.a.t^2^ + VO.t + P0

where t is the delta from prev second

The initial situation of the LEM is:

- height  Hmax - 10

- an initial Y thrust Y_Thrust_Init

- an initial vertical speed, random and small negative (> Min_Init_Speed)

- a tank full, which leads to an intial mass M + F

The moon
~~~~~~~~
It has a constant gravity g.

It generates a random ground, width (250m) made of several (18) points, so that
the delta between points (14m) > width of LEM (10m).

Points are at random height from Hpmin (2m) to Hpmax (50m). One random point
has its pred and succ forced at the same height => the landing site (28m). In
hard mode only the pred is forced to the landing height, so the area is thinner
(14m). The landing site is not at the border (right or left) of the space.

The space
~~~~~~~~~
Checks the status of the LEM (flying, landed, crashed) each second.

- flying as long as the LEM square (10x10) does not interfere with the
ground. Check the feet, both lower corners of the square.

- if ground between feet is flat, and Max_Land_Yspeed < Yspeed \<= 0 and |
Xspeed | \<= Max_Land_Xspeed \=> landed

- else crashed

Validation

.In theory,
for staying at a constant level without decreasing the mass (and without X
thrust):

|=========================================================
|                   |Full mass           |Empty mass
|Mass (kg)          | M + F = 15600      |M = 10000
|Weight (N)         | 15600 * g = 25506  |16350
|Consumption (kg/s) | 25506 * C = 46.68  |29.92
|Autonomy (s)       | 5600 / 46.68 = 120 |187
|=========================================================
Average autonomy is 152 s.

.Practically,
starting at full mass and applying a (decreasing) Y thrust to stay at a constant
level, the mission duration is around 150 s.
