The game consists in landing the LEM on the moon.
The axes are x (horizontal, left to right) and y (vertical bottom to top).

1. The LEM
Is square 10x10 m made of a rectangle and 2 feet and has an empty mass of
M kg.
It has a fuel tank of volume F kg of fuel.

It provides the following operations
- Set_X_Thrust and Set_Y_Thrust (Y_Thrust) 
  -Max_X_Thrust is applied during a fixed delay
  -Max_Y_Thrust < Y_Thrust <= 0 in N (1N = 1kg.m/s2)
  as long as there is fuel in the tank
- Get_Speed returning a speed vector (on X and Y)
- Get_Position returning a position (in X and Y)

The acceleration a is X_Thrust / m and Y_Thrust / m + g
The mass m is m0 - (X_Thrust + Y_Thrust) * C * t
Where C is the consumption rate kg/N/s
Each period, V0, P0, m0 and a are re-computed with current
thrust value (which leads to a rather accurate integration of mass
evolution).
Speed V = V0 + a.t and position P = 1/2.a.t2 + VO.t + P0
where t is the delta from prev second

The initial situation of the LEM is
 - height  Hmax - 10
 - an initial Y thrust Y_Thrust_Init
 - an initial vertical speed, random and small negative (> Min_Init_Speed)
 - a tank full, which leads to an intial mass M + F

2. The moon
Has a constant gravity g
Generates a random ground, width (500m) with a point each 10m (51 points).
Points are at random height from 0 to Hpmax, one random point from 2 to 50
has its pred and succ forced at the same height => the landing site (20m).

3. The space
Checks the status of the LEM (flying, landed, crashed) each second.
- flying as long as the LEM square (10x10) does not interfere with the
ground. Check the feet, both lower corners of the square.
- if ground between feet is flat, and Max_Land_Yspeed < Yspeed <= 0
  and | Xspeed | <= Max_Land_Xspeed => landed
- else crashed

4. The screen
Initialises displaying the ground and the LEM at init position.
Displays the LEM each 1/10s
Displays the Y thrust, Y speed and X speed current values each 0.5s

5. The inputs
<- and -> set a X thrust to Max_X_Thrust 1s
V and ^ increase/decrease Y thrust by 1/5 of Max_Y_Thrust

6. Values
Moon gravity g=1.635 m/s2 (1/6 of Earth)
F=5.600 tons
Empty mass M=10 tons
Max_Y_Thrust=44 kN
Max_X_Thrust=4 kN
C=1.83E-003 kg/N/s
Width=500 m
Hmax=200 m
Hpmax=50 m

7. Validation
Full mass is M + F = 15600 kg
Corresponding weight is 15600 * g = 25506 (25.5kN)
25506 * C = 46.68 kg/s
with an initial fuel F = 5600 kg, the autonomy is 5600 / 46.68 = 120s
(with no X thrust but without decreasing the mass).
At empty mass, the autonomy would be 187s.
