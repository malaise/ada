- Take the configuration file as argument and parse it
- Store the rules in a unique list (by name)
- Store the filters in a dynamic list (history is a circular queue)
- Arm a periodical time for each filter (user data being the position in list)
- When a timer expires:
 * Retrieve the filter
 * Exec a shell that makes tail on the file and grep -E the regex
 * If found, check each line of the result in the history
 * If not found, store in the history and execute rule
