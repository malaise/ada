Sensor
======
Version: V0.1

Sensor scans several log files and raises alerts on some events (matching
filters).

Syntax and configuration
------------------------
...............................................................
sensor <configuration file> | -h | --help | -v | --version
...............................................................

The XML configuration file defines several rules. +
Each rule has a unique name and executes a predefined shell command. The
definition of a command can refer to some variables of the form '${variable}'.
The following variable names are automatically defined:

- $\{Match} : Lines of the log that match the filter
- $\{Time} : Date and time at ISO format (YYyy-Mm-DdTHh:Mm:Ss.mmm)
- $\{Host}: Local host name

All the other variables must be defined in the environment, otherwise this is
an error. +
 +
The configuration file then defines filters. Each filter consists in:

- a file name (the name of the file to scan)
- an optional scanning period in seconds (default 10.0)
- an optional tail size to scan (default 100 lines)
- an history of alerts to store (default 10)
- the name of the rule to execute


Processing
----------
.Init
 * Parse the argument and the configuration file
 * Check the expansion of each rule (variables) and store the rules in a
unique list (by name)
 * Store the filters in a dynamic list (history is a circular queue), check
that the referenced rule exists
 * Arm a periodical time for each filter (user data being the position in list)
 * When a timer expires:

.When a timer expires:
 * Retrieve the filter
 * Extract the tail of the file and search the regex
 * If found, check each line of the result versus the history
 * If not found, store in the history
 * Execute the rule if some matches
