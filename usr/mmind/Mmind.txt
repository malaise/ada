Master Mind
===========

This is the classic "Master Mind" game, where the goal is to guess a secret
combination of colors, by successive tries and answers.

The secret is made of 3 to 5 pins among 8 colors. At each try you propose a
combination, and you get an answer of how many pins are correcty placed (same
color at the same location) and how many pins are misplaced.

The official game exists in two variants: 

- 'Clasic' with 4 columns and 10 rows
- 'Super' with 5 columns and 12 rows.

In this came you can choose from 3 to 5 columns and you have up to 12 tries to
guess the secret (If you want, you have to apply the limit to 10 tries by
yourself).

Presentation of the screen
--------------------------

There are four areas:

.The menu,
on the bottom right, allows aborting the current game, starting a new game,
changing the level (number of columns - when not playing -), and exiting the
game.

.The colors,
the column in the middle of the screen, is a read-only area allowing to pick a
color pin and to put it in a proposal.

.The proposals,
on the left, is made of 12 rows, each filled progressively with color pins.
Once a row is complete, it is possible to submit the combination.

.The answers,
between the proposals and the colors, contains the answers to submitted
combinations. It can be either:

- "XXXX": The proposal is not complete or already answered previously, and it 
cannot be answered),

- "????": The proposal is complete and can be answered,

- An answer: Some black and white pins, including no pin at all.

Command line arguments
----------------------
  Usage: mmind [ <text_mode> ] [ <init_level> ] [ <init_code> ]
    <text_mode>    ::= -t | --text
    <init_level>   ::= [ -l <level> | --level=<level> ]
    <level>        ::= 3 | 4 | 5      // Default 4
    <init_code>    ::= [ -c <code> | --code=<code> ]
    <code>         ::= { <color_letter> } | { <color_number> }
    <color_letter> ::=  { B | T | C | R | M | W | G | Y }
    <color_number> ::= 1 .. 8         // For text mode

.Text mode
Text mode is a variant that plays one game with no graphics. The colors are
replaced by digits from 1 to 8 and the answers are made of two numbers: number
of "colors" correctly placed and number of "colors" misplaced. 

.Level
This options allows setting the level (from 3 to 5) of the first game in
graphic mode (or the level of the text game).

.Init code
Useful for testing the game, this option allows pre-setting the secret
code

- in text mode, this is the secret sequence of digits (from 1 to 8) to find.
- in graphic mode, this is the sequence of colors to find in the first game.
This code is then shown during the first game, and then hidden and secret again
in subsequent games. +
Each color is denoted by one letter:
  * Y for Yellow
  * G for Green
  * W for White (light grey)
  * M for Magenta
  * R for Red
  * C for Cyan
  * T for Tomato
  * B for Blue

How to play
-----------

Mainly, a round consists in filling a proposal then submitting it and getting
and answer. The proposals that have been answered cannont be modified any more.
On the other hand, any proposal can be filled and submited, providing that
it is not answered.

Filling a proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fill a proposal you can:

.Pick a color, from either:
- The colors area. Select a color here, then select a cell in an available (not
answered) proposal. The selected color will be copied into the destination
cell, overwriting its content if any.

- An answered proposal. Like from the colors area, the color will be copied
into the target cell.

- A not-answered proposal, including the one of the target cell. In this case
the pin is *moved* from the selected cell into the target cell. +

.Remove a pin (clearing the cell)
by double clicking on it.

.Clear a full proposal (row)
by double clicking in the corresponding answer area. If the proposal is not
complete, or if has already been answered previously, then it will be cleared.

NOTE: Beware that if the proposal is complete and not already answered, then it
will be answered (at first click).

.Copy an answered proposal
by double clicking in the corresponding answer area. This will copy the
answered proposal into the first empty proposal.

Submitting a proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once a proposal is complete, the corresponding answer area shows "????", and a
simple click in this answer triggers the submition.

If the selected proposal is not just above the last anwered, then it is
swapped with the one there, then answered.

End of the game
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game ends, and the secret combination becomes shown, when either:

.you find the secret combination
you submit a proposal and it matches.

.you fail
you submit all the 12 possible proposals without finding the secret.

.you give up
you click in "GIVE UP" menu.
