Master Mind
===========

This is the classic "master mind" game, where the goal is to guess a secret
combination of colors, by successive tries and answers.

The secret is made of 3 to 5 pins among 8 colors. At each try you propose a
combination and you get an answer of how many pins are correcty placed (same
color at the same location) and how many pins are misplaced.

You have up to 12 tries to guess the secret. The official games

There are four areas:

.The menu,
on the bottom right, allows aborting the current game, starting a new game,
changing the level (number of columns - when nott playing -), and exiting the
game.

.The colors,
the column in the middle of the screen, is a read-only area allowing to pick a
pin of a color and put it in a proposal.

.The proposals,
on the left, is made of 12 rows, each filled progressively with color pins.
Once a row is complete it is possible to submit the combination.

.The answers,
between the proposals and the colors, contains the answers to submitted
combinations. It can be either:

- "XXXX": The proposal is not complete (and cannot be answered)

- "????": The proposal is complete and can be answered

- An answer: Some black and white pins, including no pin at all

How to play
-----------

Mainly, a round consists in filling a proposal then submitting it in order to
get and answer. The proposals that have been answered cannont be modified at
all. On the other hand, any proposal can be filled and submited, providing that
it is not answered.

Filling a proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to fill a proposal you can:

.Pick a color, from either:

- The colors area. Select a color here, then select a cell in an available (not
answered) proposal. The selected color will be copied into the destination
cell, possibli overwriting its content.

- An answered proposal. Like from the colors area, the color will be copied
into the target cell.

- A not-answered proposal, including the one of the target cell. In this case
the pin is moved from the selected cell into the target cell.

.Remove a pin (clearing the cell) by double clicking on it.

.Clear a full proposal (row)
by double clicking in the corresponding (same
row) answer area. If the proposal is not complete, or complete and already
answered, then it will be cleared. Beware that if it is complete and not
already answered, then it will be answered (at first click).

.Copy the last answered proposal into an empty proposal
by double clicking in the corresponding answer area.

Submitting a proposal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once a proposal is complete, the corresponding answer area shows "????", and a
simple click in the answer triggers the sublition.

If the selected proposal is not just above the last anwered, then it is
swapped with the one there, then answered.
