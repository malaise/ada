Allow continue, quit abort options to cherry-pick (2)


(1) In the Cherry-pick menu
- keep the "=" for "already merged not modifable", skipped
- keep the " " for "skip", button Remove renamed Skip
- Use "V" for "pick and go on", button Pik&Meld
- Use "?" for "pick and edit for commit", button Pik&Edit
- Use "!" for "pick and apply", button Pik&Appl
- Keep the Reset and Detail buttons
Init the list with '!' and '='.

Process the list from top to bottom, keeping in mind last action (init to
'None':
As long as there are 'V' and a '?', concat the SHA,
On '?', call:
- CherryPick -n on the list of SHAs, reset the list
- Commit screen, that returns OK (commit done or skipped, continue)
or Quit (Quit by used, stop loop).
On '!', call:
- CherryPick -n on the list of SHAs if any, reset the list
- CherryPick this SHA

So need a Cherrypick -n, Commit to become a function (QuitIOPush : in Boolean)
return Boolean;

(2) 3 buttons to add in the cherrypick menu: continue, quit, abort.
Which makes 9 buttons (Pik&Meld, Pik&Comm, Pik&Apply, Skip, Detail, Reset,
Continue, Quit, Abort) too many for the History descriptor.
=> Create a new descriptor and move cherry-pick mangement out of History
package, in a new package.
