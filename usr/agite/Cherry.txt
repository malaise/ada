Checkout dest branch
Create tmp_branch
Checkout tmp_branch
Cherry-pick from origin (1)
Checkout origin
Reset --hard tmp_branch
Delete tmp_branch


(1) In the Cherry-pick menu
- keep the "=" for "already merged not modifable", skipped
- keep the " " for "skip", button Remove renamed Skip
- Use "A" for "pick and go on", button Apply
- Use "E" for "pick and edit for commit", button Edit
- Use "C" for "pick and commit", button Commit
- Keep the Reset and Detail buttons
Init the list with 'C' and '='.

Process the list from top to bottom
On 'V', call
- CherryPick -n on the SHA
- Go on looping
On '?', call:
- CherryPick -n on the SHA
- Commit screen, that returns OK (commit done or skipped, continue looping)
or Quit (Quit by used, stop loop).
On '!', call:
- CherryPick on the SHA
- Go on looping

So need a Cherrypick -n, Commit to become a function (QuitIOPush : in Boolean)
return Boolean;
New buttons, so: Apply, Edit, Commit, in addition to Skip, Detail, Reset.

Quitting the commit returns to the main (Directory) screen. But as long as:
- The same orig and dest branch are selected,
- CherryPick Reset is not called,
the CherryPick screen shall maintain the list issued from original selection
and processing so far:
- Reassess the Cherry list
- Remove items that have disappeared
- Set "=" to all items already merged in the new list
- Add new items with tag 'C'
