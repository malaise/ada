Agite user guide
================
Pascal MALAISE <malaise@magic.fr>
V5.0

General purpose
---------------
Agite (Ada GIT Editor) is a graphical front end of the 'Git' configuration
management tool.
It is directory-oriented.
Major functions are navigation in directories and history, file status and
graphical diff.

anchor:XCommandLine[]

Command line
------------
  Usage: agite [ -n | --no_history ] [ <path> | -p | --previous ]

By default Agite continuously stores the current directory in its
xref:XConfig[configuration file].
This allows restarting Agite in the same directory as when it stopped by
providing the argument '-p' or '--previous'.

On the other hand this feature is hardly compatible with several instances of
Agite running in parallel. Other instances of the program shall not save the
current directory, which is achieved by providing the argument '-n' or
'--no_history'.

Instead of previous directory the start-up directory can be explicitly
specified in the command line with '<path>'. By default Agite starts in
the current directory.

Environment variables
---------------------
AFPX_DATA_DIR::
Agite is based on Afpx screen manager, which reads the configuration files
AFPX.DSC, AFPX.FLD and AFPX.INI. Either theses files are in the current
directory at startup or the environment variable 'AFPX_DATA_DIR' must be
set to the directory containing these files.

Note: Agite unsets AFPX_DATA_DIR at start-up so its children don't inherit
from this setting.

AGITE_CONF_FILE::
Agite allows several settings to be defined in a 
xref:XConfig[configuration file]. By default this file is 
'$\{HOME}/.agite/agite.xml' but this can be overridden by setting the
environment variable 'AGITE_CONF_FILE' to the full path and name of the
configuration file.

GIT_DIR::
Agite needs to know the root directory of the current Git sandbox (if any). It
finds it by locating, in current directory or above, the Git technical
directory.
By default it is named '.git' but this can be overridden by setting the
environment variable 'GIT_DIR' to the name of the Git directory.

anchor:XConfig[] 

Configuration file
------------------
User defined configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Agite reads at start-up some user-defined configuration parameters.

anchor:XConfXterm[]

xterm::
This defines the command to be launched when the
xref:XXterm[xterm] button is selected. Example: 'gnome-terminal --zoom=0.9'

anchor:XConfEditor[]

editor::
This defines the command to be launched for editing a file (either with
double click in the list or by selecting the xref:XEdit[Edit] button.
+
Note: This command should rather not return until completion so that Agite
properly refreshes the status of files when it exits.

anchor:XConfDiff[]

differator::
This defines the command to be launched for performing a xref:XDiff[diff]
between two versions of a file. Agite will launch 'git difftool -y -x
<differator> HEAD -- <file>' for the diff between current file and GIT
repository and 'git difftool -y -x <differator> <ref_rev> <comp_rev> -- <file>'
for the diff between two revisions of a file.

anchor:XConfPeriod[]

period::
Agite refreshes the current status of files in the xref:Xdir[directory] screen
when it starts xref:XGui[Git GUI] or xref:XEdit[Editor] and when they exit.
This is because these tools can modify the current status of local files. Still,
it is possible from a stand-alone terminal to also modify the list or status of
local files. This is why Agite preiodically checks and redisplays the status of
local files. This parameter defines the period in seconds of this automatic
check.
+
0.0 disables the feature.
+
Note: a manual refresh is always possible with the xref:XReread[Reread] button.

Agite persistent data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Agite also uses the configuration file to store information from one invocation
to another.

last_dir::
Agite continuously stores the current directory in this entry. See the 
xref:XCommandLine[arguments] '-p' ('--previous') and '-n' ('--no_history') for
how to use or disable this feature.

bookmarks::
Agite stores the xref:XBookmarks[bookmarks] in this section:

* blank lines have no 'Name' nor content,
* separators have a 'Name' and no content,
* bookmarks have a content and possibly a 'Name'.

*Note: The DTD file 'agite.dtd' must be located in the same directory as the
Agite XML configuration file.*

Agite screens
-------------
Agite is based on four main menus:

* Directory: This is the first menu at start-up. It shows the content of a
directory.
* Bookmarks:  This menu allows bookmarking directories and quickly jumping
to a bookmark
* History: This shows the Git history of a file or directory, the list of
commits that have modified the file(s).
* Commit details: This shows informations on a commit, including the list
of files modified by the commit.

The navigation is as follows:

                        +-----------+
                /------>| Bookmarks |
  +---------- +/        +-----------+
  | Directory |
  +---------- +\        +---------+       +--------+
                \------>| History |<----->| Commit |
                        +---------+       +--------+


All the screen transitions are based on the 'call-return' scheme.
So please note the double arrow between 'History' and 'Commit': from the
'History' of a file (or dir) you can select a commit and and see its 'Detail'.
In this new screen you can select a file and see its 'History'... and so on.
Once this is done you we need to "un-stack" all these menus (by clicking on
the 'Back' button in each) in order to go back to the 'Directory'.

anchor:XDir[]

Directory status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'Directory' menu lists the git content, subdirectories and files, of
current directory. We find from top to bottom:

Title::
The first line shows the title and current version of Agite.
+
On the left is the indication of current Git branch.
+
On the right is the indication of current host.

Root::
This line shows the root directory of the current Git sandbox. Clicking in this
fields moves current directory to the root.

Go::
This line shows the current directory. It also allows entering a path and going
to it by hitting the key 'Return' or clicking in th 'Go' button.

anchor:XReread[]

Reread::
Normally Agite re-scans the current directory and refreshes the list and status
when necessary, and also periodically if the feature is enabled (see
Xref:XConfReread[period] configuration option). This button explicitly refreshes
the current display.

Dir Up::
This button allows moving up to parent directory.

Bookmarks::
This button activates the xref:XBookmarks[Bookmarks] menu.

PushD and Popd::
These buttons allows storing the current directory ('PushD') then later on
allows moving back to it ('PopD').

@@@ We are 'Here' @@@ More details on the logic (Curr / D1 / D2).


List::
For a file, the two first characters are the status (MADRC)
(Modified-unstaged/Modified/Added/Deleted/OK), then a space. For dirs there
are 2 spaces.

Then the name, then a space, then the kind (' ' fo files, '@' for symbolic
links, '/' for directories or '?' for others).

A quick search function allows searhing first file that starts with the selected
key or above.

Double click on an entry does:

- if a directory -> move to it

- if a file -> launch X editor on it


anchor:XGui[]

GitGUI::

anchor:XXterm[]

Xterm::
This button starts a X terminal by launching the command defined
in the xref:XConfXterm[xterm] entry of the configuration file.

anchor:XEdit[]

Edit::
This button launches an editor (defined in the xref:XConfEditor[editor] entry of
the configuration file) on the file currently selected in the list, as a double
click on this file would do.

anchor:XDiff[]

Diff::
This bouton launches a graphical difference tool (as defined in the
xref:XConfDiff[differator] entry of the configuration file) to show the
differences between current version of a file and the version in GIT HEAD.

Note: If the file is not locally modified this button does nothing.

A bouton allows to switch to history of currently selected entry.

A bouton allows to switch to bookmarks.

A bouton allows to exit.

anchor:XBookmarks[]

Bookmarks
~~~~~~~~~
Locations (directories) can be bookmarked.

A menu lists the known bookmarks and buttons allow to:

- go to a bookmark, as for a double click (returns to main)

- add current dir to bookmarks (with a given name if any)

- add a separator in the list (with a given name if any)

- Move current entry up or down

- delete a bookmark

- return to main screen

History
~~~~~~~
The history of a file or dir is listed (Head on top), each line with the date
(YYMMDD:HHMM) a space then the comment.

Left click in list allows selecting reference version and right click selects
version to compare.

A button switches to a screen with the detailed list of files modified by this
entry of the history.

If a file, a button launches X diff from previous to this entry of the
history.

A button allows to return to main screen.

Details
~~~~~~~
The Details screen shows for a commit:

- The commit SHA value

- The date YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

- 3 lines of comment

- The list of files, each preceeded by a letter M/A/D and a space

Interfaces with Git
-------------------
These functions use Command to call git and parse result.

Requires git 1.7.0 or above.

A function lists current entries and status.

- "git ls-files" => a list of current files

- "git status -uno --porcelain" => modif versus stage, for the whole box

- merge lists: apply the status to local file (discard others)

A function logs history of file or dir

- "git log --name-status --date=iso -- <path>"

A function lists files mofied by a commit

- git log --name-status --date=iso -n 1 <hash>

A function starts graphical diff

- "git difftool -y -t HEAD <file>" in background
