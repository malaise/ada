- Fix indentation:
  * Of stuff put in comment (e.g. types), propagate original indent after "--"
  * Of stuff not put in comment, propagate original indent
- Detect empty body (make parse_package/procedure/function/context functions
  returning boolea). Remove body with warning if empty.
- Truncate long (non comment) line (String_Mng + Output)
- Restore cleanup of boby on error
- Test with rep clause (for T use record...)
