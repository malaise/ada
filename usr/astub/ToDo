- Modify Output so that it puts only when it gets a newline
  * bufferize until a Lf
  * add a flush and call it at the end
  * add a reset_indent that removes any leading separator from buffer
    use this to change the policy (between context->function/procedure/package):
    these shall indent themself (after resetting indent).
NO. Use Words.

- Parse types explicitly, so that comments are output together with type in
  comment:
- Fix indentation:
  * Of stuff put in comment (e.g. types), propagate original indent after "--"
  * Of stuff not put in comment, propagate original indent
- Detect empty body (make parse_package/procedure/function/context functions
  returning boolean). Remove body with warning if at level 0 and empty.
- Truncate long (non comment) line (String_Mng + Output)
- Restore cleanup of boby on error
- Test with rep clause (for T use record...)
