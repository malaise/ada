Input: ads file name.
Output: adb file (only if it does not already exist).

Uses Ada_Parser to parse ads file and generates a stub of body:
- Rejects spec with "body", "separate"...
- Sets correct indentation
- Propagates comments,
- Copy as comment all what is not expandable (with and use clauses,
  constants, types, instanciations, private part, representation clause,
  abstract subprogram...),
- Expands spec of procedure, function, task, protected type and package
  as described in section A.

A: Expansion rules
------------------

1. Procedure
------------
procedure Pr [ (Args) ] ;

Is expanded as:

procedure Pr [ (Args) ] is
begin
  null;
end Pr;

2. Function
-----------
function F [ (Args) ] return Ty;

Is expanded as:

function F [ (Args) ] return Ty is
begin
  return F [ (Args) ];
end F;

3. Task and task type
---------------------
task [ type ] Ta;
or
task [ type ] Ta is
  entry E (Args);
end Ta;

Is expanded as:

task body Ta is
begin
  null;
end Ta;

5. Protected object and protected type
--------------------------------------
protected [ type ] Pr is
  entry En [ (Atype) ] [ (Args) ] ;
  -- Procedure and function declarations
end Pr;

Is expanded (with its procedures, functions expanded as above) as:

protected body Pr is
  entry En [ (for I in Atype) ] [ (Args) ] when True is
  begin
    null;
  end En;
  -- Expanded procedures and functions
end Pr;

5. Package
----------
package Pa is
  -- Declarations
end Pa;

Is expanded (with its procedures, functions, tasks, protected objects expanded
as above) as:

package body Pa is
  -- Expanded declarations
end Pa;

B: States when parsing
----------------------
Parsing the spec consists in: 
- do the processing of current object declaration
- look for chaining reserved words that declares a sub-object
- skip any unexpected reserved word:
  * forbid separate
  * parse until ; (outside parentheses), put each line in comment
- look for ending ';' that make it change state.
Always copies comments and put unexepected contructs in comment.
The parser evolves between several states, each of them having its own list of
chaining and ending words.
The parser must keep trace of level of sub-object (package of package...)
for indentation, called obj_level and starting at 0.

The common function Check_Renames checks if the lexic after object identifier is
the reserved word "renames". If yes this must be expanded as a comment and
this ends the current state.

Object name expands up to '(', ';' or separator, which covers A.B.C or "**".

1. In_Context
The context clauses section, at level 0.
Chains: [ private ] procedure, function, package
Ends: End of file.

2. In_Procedure
Process: Check_Renames, expand
Chains: none
Ends: ;

3. In_function
Process: Check_Renames, expand
Chains: none
Ends: ;

4. In_Task
Process: expand
Chains: none
Ends: ;

5. In_Protected
Process: expand
Chains: entry, procedure, function
Ends: ;

6. In_Entry
Process: expand
Chains: none
Ends: ;

7. In_Package
Process: Check_Renames, expand
Chains: procedure, function, package
Ends: ;
