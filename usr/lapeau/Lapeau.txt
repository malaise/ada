La Peau
=======
V3.1

"La Peau" is a solitaire card game.

Goal of the game
----------------

Initially, 52 cards are randomly put on the table in 13 rows of 4 cards each.

The goal is to move the cards, one by one, in order to re-organise the cards in
crescent order into 4 sorted stacks.

Playing areas
-------------

Playing stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main playing area is made of the 13 Playing stacks, initially containing 4
cards each.

In this area the cards are stacked in decrescent order (King, Queen, Jack,
10 .. 2, Ace).

The game can be played with one of the following stacking policies:

 * Same suite: The cards of a stack must be all of the same suit (Spade, Club,
Heart, Diamond),

 * Alternate colors: The colors (red / black) must alternate, which is the
default.

Done stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~
This area contains 4 stacks, one for each suit, where the cards can be stacked
in crescent order (Ace, 2 .. 10, Jack, Queen, King).

Menu
~~~~
.On the left side, the menu provides functions that abort the current game:

Exit::
This button stops and quits the game (the same way as the \'X' cross on the top-right
corner of the window (depending on the window manager).

New::
This button stops the current game and starts a new one.

Start::
This button stops the current game and starts from scratch the game which number
has been entered in the field beside the button, or restarts the current game if
this number is invalid.

Switch::
This button allows changing the stacking policy ('same suit' or
'alternate colors') when then game is not in progress. On its right, the
current policy is indicated.

.On the right side are the functions that interact with the current game:

Purge::
This button moves in the Done stacks as many cards as possible, according to
the current stacking policy.

Undo::
This button un-does one by one the previous card movements (potentially up
to the beginning of the current game).

Redo::
This button re-does one by one the un-done movements (potentially up to the
first un-done one).

NOTE: The movements, the Undo and Redo are completely reversible, except that
any explicit movement, while in a Undo/Redo sequence, completely resets the
history of the movements that can be un-done.

Detailed rules
--------------

How to play
~~~~~~~~~~~
A card is selected by left-clicking on it. Selectable cards are identified by
the mouse cursor becomming a hand when above them.

Once a card is selected, its color becomes reversed, the cursor remains a hand,
denoting that it is time to select the destination (or to cancel the selection
by clicking again on the same card).

The destination can be:

* the Done stack with the same suit as the selected card,

* a card on top of a Play stack, if this makes a decrescent sequence
compatible with the stacking policy,

* an empty Play stack.

Valid destinations are identified by becomming reversed when the cursor is
above them, and the mouse cursor becomes a down arrow. The destination is
validated by clicking then releasing on it.

NOTE: Initially, the cards are set randomly, which rarely leads to compatible
stacks, so as soon as a card is moved it is rarely possible to move it back
(it migh be possible in 'alternate color' mode though). But it is always
possible to undo.

Stacking policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
anchor:XPolicy[]
There are two different policies for stacking the cards in the playing area:

.Alternate color
This is the default policy, where the cards can be stacked only when their
colors (red/black) are alternated (and in decrescent order). +
This variant has more chance to be achievable.

.Same suit
When this policy is selected, the cards can be stacked only when they
are of the same suit (and in decrescent order).

This behaviour is triggered by launching the program with the argument
'--same'.

NOTE: For backward compatibility, the program argument '--alternate' is supported
but has no effect because this policy is the default one.

Moving to Done stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.Right click
A right click on a selectable card directly moves it to its Done stack if this
is valid.

.Impact of the policy on the purge
The stacking policy impacts the behavior of the 'Purge' function.

When in 'same suit' mode, if a card can be purged to its Done stack (if its
ancestor is already stacked there), then it is useless in the playing area. So
the purge will automatically move this card in its Done stack.

But in 'alternate color', a card of a suit can be used as relay for a card of
another color. In this case the card is not purged.

For example, a 4 of Club can be used as relay for a 3 of Heart or Diamond. But
this 3 will not need a relay if it can be Done (if its corresponding 2 is
already Done). As a consequence, the 4 of Club is purged if both the 2 of Heart
and the 2 of Diamond are already Done.

.Not using the Done stacks
Using the Done stacks is not mandatory, which allows different variants:

-  Do not use the Done stacks at all (the game becomes by far more
difficult, and also more likely unfeasible),
- Only allow the aces to go in the Done stacks,
- Use the Done stacks as less as possible...

NOTE: Once a card is stacked in its Done stack, it cannot be moved back on
a Play stack. But it is always possible to undo.

Multiple moves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within the play area it is possible to move automatically several cards.
But the rule of moving cards one by one is always enforced. So multiple move
is possible only if:

* the cards to move form a valid sequence,
* the destination is either a free Play stack, or the destination card is a
valid ancestor for the sequence,
* the number of free stacks allows the movement of the cards one by one.

Moving several cards is achieved by selecting a card somewhere within a valid 
sequence (often the biggest card of the sequence), then selecting its
destination.

The algorithm to dispatch a stack on a target is efficient and covers most
use-cases. Here is the logic:

1. it first unstacks as many cards as possible from the original stack 
into the free stacks,

2. then it restacks these cards on the last unstacked (temporary stack)

3. then it iterates these operations until the ancestor of the original
stack is reached

4. then it moves this ancestor to its destination

5. then it unstacks the temporary stacks on the destination, using the
free stacks that are progressively released.

This algorithm allows moving, with 'S' free stacks, a stack of
'S * (S + 1) / 2 + 1' cards free stacks.

|===================================
|Nb free Play stacks |Nb cards moved
|1              |2
|2              |4
|3              |7
|4              |11
|===================================

NOTE: This algorithm is efficient and covers most use cases, but it is not
optimal. For example, with 3 stacks, it will store 3, then 2, then 1 cards in
temporary stacks, allowing 7 cards to be moved. But a better strategy is
to move 2 cards in temporary stacks, then stack them, then move and stack
again 2 other cards, then move the first temporary stack on the second, then
stack 2 other cards, then 1. This way it becomes possible to store 7 cards in
the 3 stacks, so to move 8 cards. And the difference between both logics
increases with the number of free stacks.

Game number
-----------

Each game is identified by a number between 0 and 999999. The current game
number is displayed in the title of the main window.

Each 'New' game is a random one, and by default the first game is also random.
Still, it is possible to specify, as program argument, the number of the first
game to start with. +
Also, it is possible to start a given game by entering the game number and then
clicking on the 'Start' button.

Why the name 'La Peau'
----------------------
This game was introduced in my family by a great-uncle, whose surname was
"La Peau". +
This nickname came from "la peau de n√©nuphar", but nobody anymore can explain
why...
