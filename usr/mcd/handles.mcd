# Compute when to both hands of a clock overlap (ex, at 0h00)

# Given a clock at a time h.m (in hours and minutes):
# - The hour hand position (in 1/60Â°) is ph = h*5 + 5*m/60
# - The minute hand position is pm = m
# So, for each h in 0 .. 11 there is a m so that ph = pm
# 5*h + m/12 = m
# 11*m/12 = 5*h
# m = 60 * h / 11
