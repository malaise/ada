Four Twenty On (421)
====================

This is a simulation of the dice game 421.

Presentation of the game
------------------------
Principles of the games
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The game is played by at least 2 players with 3 dices and 21 tokens.
It is decomposed into several sccessive sets, each made of two different steps:

- The 'load' step during which the tokens are dispatched from the kitty to the
players,
- The 'unload' step where the players try to give their tokens to the others.

When a player has no more token he stops playing the set. The looser of the
set is the player who has received all the tokens from the other players.

The first player who looses 2 sets looses the game and pays a penalty.

Dice combinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The tokens are exchanged among players according to the scores obtained with
the dices. The table below lists the combinations from the highest to the lowest
and indicates the value of each combination.

Course of the set
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The load
^^^^^^^^
.Who starts the load?

Each player throws a dice. The player with the lowest value (1 is lower than
6) starts the load.

.Course of a turn

The first player starts the turn. He throws the 3 dices and annouces the
combination and the value, ex: "Ace two for two".

The player at his left throws the 3 dices. He annouces the combination and the
total so far for the turn, ex: "Ace three for five". And so on until all
players have thrown.

If two or more players have the same smallest combination this is a
xref:XRampo[rampo].

The player with the lowest combination receives from the kitty the total
amount of points cumulated during the turn, including the points obtained
during the xref:XRampo[rampo] if any. This marks the end of the turn and
this player starts the next turn.

.End of the load

The load step ends when the kitty is empty.

If a player has no token at all at the end of the load then he does not play the
next step (unload) and cannot loose the set. If a player has all the token at
the end of the load then he looses the set (the unload step is not played at
all).

The unload
^^^^^^^^^^
The loads ends and the unload starts when the kitty is empty.

.Start of the turn
The player who has got the last tokens from the kitty starts the first turn. He
throws the dices up to three times. He annouces each combination and the total
so far for the turn. The first player stop after the first, second or third
throw, when he want. He annouces the combination, the number ot throws and the
total so far for the turn, ex: "Ace six in two for eight".

.Other players, number of throws
During the turn the remaining players try to make the highest combination in the
same number of throws as the first player. Before each throw a player can
decide that this is the last throw of his go. Hi annouces this decision by
hitting the table with the dices that he has in hand.

.Throwing ans saving dices
After the first and after the second throw a player can leave some dices on the
table and take the others for another throw. He can change his mind (at third
throw he can take some dices that he left after first throw). If a dice thrown
hits a dice left on the table the the new value of the dice is taken into
account!

.Paying
At the end of the turn (including playing xref:XRampo[rampo] for the highest
combination and a xref:XRampo[rampo] for the lowest combination) the player with
the highest combination gives to the one with the lowest the number of tokens
scored during the whole turn (or as many token as he has). The player who has
lost the turn starts the new one.

.End of the set
When a player has no more token he is out of the set (and cannot loos it). The
looser of the set is the player who has collected all the token at the end of
the set.

The rampo
^^^^^^^^^
.When
anchor:XRampo[]The rampo is the situation when several players have the same
combination and when one must loose or win. This occurs when:

- several players have the same smallest combination during the load or during
the unload. The looser of the rampo will be the looser of the turn.
- several players have the same highest combination during the unload. The
winner of the rampo will be the winner of the turn.

.Announces
Each time a player makes a combination in the situation above he annouces
"Rampo". When each player has played his turn then the last Rampo announces
"hot hand". If there is a rampo for lowest and a rampo for highest scores,
then the lowest hot hand is announced and the corresponding rampo is played
before the hot hand and rampo for highest.

.Playing the rampo
The rampo is played like the load. Each player throws the dices once and
annouces the combination and the total so far for the turn, except that the
players play in reverse order: The hot hand first, then the player at his right,
and so on.

There can be a new rampo within the rampo. It is annouced as usual and
then played, back in the "normal" order, and so on.
