Freecell
========
V3.1

Freecell is a famous solitaire card game.

Goal of the game
----------------

Initially, 52 cards are randomly put on the table in 8 rows, 4 rows of 7 cards
and 4 rows of 6 cards.

The goal is to move the cards, one by one, in order to re-organise the cards in
crescent order into 4 sorted stacks.

Playing areas
-------------

Playing stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The main playing area is made of the 8 Playing stacks, initially containing
the 52 cards each.

In this area the cards are stacked in decrescent order (King, Queen, Jack,
10 .. 2, Ace) and in alternate colors (red / black).

Tempo stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This area, in the top center, contains 4 stacks in which any card can be
stored, only one card per stack.

Done stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~
This area contains 4 stacks (red cards on the left and black cards on the
right), one for each suit, where the cards can be stacked in crescent order
(Ace, 2 .. 10, Jack, Queen, King).

Menu
~~~~
.On the left side, the menu provides functions that abort the current game:

Exit::
This button stops and quits the game (the same way as the \'X' cross on the top-right
corner of the window depending on the window manager).

New::
This button stops the current game and starts a new one.

Start::
This button stops the current game and starts from scratch the game which number
has been entered in the field beside the button, or restarts the current game if
this number is invalid.

.On the right side are the functions that interact with the current game:

Purge::
This button moves in the Done stacks as many cards as possible.

Undo::
This button un-does one by one the previous card movements (potentially up
to the beginning of the current game).

Redo::
This button re-does one by one the un-done movements (potentially up to the
first un-done one).

NOTE: The movements, the Undo and Redo are completely reversible, except that
any explicit movement, while in a Undo/Redo sequence, completely resets the
history of the movements that can be un-done.

Detailed rules
--------------

How to play
~~~~~~~~~~~
A card is selected by a left-click then release on it. Selectable cards are
identified by the mouse cursor becomming a hand when above them.

Once a card is selected, its color becomes reversed, the cursor remains a hand,
denoting that it is time to select the destination (or to cancel the selection
by clicking again on the same card).

The destination can be:

* the Done stack with the same suit as the selected card,

* a Tempo stack if any is available,

* a card on top of a Play stack, if this makes a decrescent sequence with
alternate color,

* an empty Play stack.

Valid destinations are identified by becomming reversed when the cursor is
above them, and the mouse cursor becomes a down arrow. The destination is
validated by clicking then releasing on it.

NOTE: Initially, the cards are set randomly, which rarely leads to compatible
stacks, so as soon as a card is moved it is rarely possible to move it back.
But it is always possible to undo.

Moving to Done stacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.Right click
A right click on a selectable card directly moves it to its Done stack if this
is valid, otherwise moves it in a Tempo stack if available.

.Automatic purge
A card of a suit can be used as relay for a card of another color.
In this case the card is not purged.

For example, a 4 of Club can be used as relay for a 3 of Heart or Diamond. But
this 3 will not need a relay if it can be Done (if its corresponding 2 is
already Done). As a consequence, the 4 of Club is purged if both the 2 of Heart
and the 2 of Diamond are already Done.

NOTE: Once a card is stacked in its Done stack, it cannot be moved back on
a Play stack. But it is always possible to undo.

Multiple moves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Within the play area it is possible to move automatically several cards.
But the rule of moving cards one by one is always enforced. So multiple move
is possible only if:

* the cards to move form a valid sequence,
* the destination is either a free Play stack, or the destination card is a
valid ancestor for the sequence,
* the number of available Tempo stack and of free Play stacks allows the
movement of the cards one by one.

Moving several cards is achieved by selecting a card somewhere within a valid
sequence (often the biggest card of the sequence), then selecting its
destination.

The algorithm to move a stack to a target has the following logic:

1. it first unstacks as many cards as possible from the original stack
into the available Tempo stacks,

2. then it unstacks as many cards as possible from the original stack
into the free stacks,

3. then it restacks all these cards but the last (from free stacks then from
Tempo stacks) on the last unstacked (temporary stack)

4. then it iterates these operations until the ancestor of the original
stack is reached

5. then it moves this ancestor to its destination

6. then it unstacks the temporary stacks on the destination, using the
free stacks that are progressively released and Tempo stacks.

This algorithm allows, with 'T' available Tempo stacks and 'S' free playing
stacks, moving a sequence of 'S * (S + 1) / 2 + S * T + T + 1' cards.

NOTE: This algorithm is efficient and covers most use cases, but it is not
optimal. For example, with 3 stacks (and 0 Tempo), it will store 3, then 2,
then 1 cards in these stacks, allowing 7 cards to be moved. But a better
strategy is to move 2 cards in temporary stacks, then stack them, then move and
stack again 2 other cards, then move the first temporary stack on the second,
then stack 2 other cards, then 1. This way it becomes possible to store 7 cards
in the 3 stacks, so to move 8 cards. And the difference between both logics
increases with the number of free stacks.

Game number
-----------

Each game is identified by a number between 0 and 999999. The current game
number is displayed in the title of the main window.

Each 'New' game is a random one, and by default the first game is also random.
still, it is possible to specify as program argument the number of the first
game to start with. +
Also, it is possible to start a given game by entering the game number and then
clicking on the 'Start' button.
