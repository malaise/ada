1. General description
tcpchat takes 2 arguments: a TCP port name or num and a chats file name.
It listens on the port and accepts one TCP connection at a time: new connections are not
accepted while one client is connected.
It expects to receive one or several sentences (a sentence is one line terminated by Lf)
and replies by one or several sentences.


2. Chat file and behaviour
The chat file describes several alternative chats.
Each chat script starts with one or several expected sentences (keyword "receive").
It is an error if two different chat scripts expect the same first sentence.
If tcpchat recevies an unexpected sentence it closes the TCP connection and listens again.
The list of expected sentences ends with the list of actions to perform: either wait some
milliseconds or send a sentence. The list can contain several actions or be empty.
The list of actions ends when: 
- either one (or several) new expected sentence is defined, then tcpchat expects them,
then performs actions...
- or with a close directive, then tcpchat closes the connection,
- or end of the chat, then tcpchat goes back expecting any chat.
