+ Move Xml_Generator as a child package of Xml_Parser
+ Add it a function Init_From_Parsed (Ctx : Ctx_Type) return Xml_Dscr_Type;
  (move the code from Xml_Checker) and use it in Xml_Checker. Add checks that
  then the tree of elements can be modified, but not the prologue nor the root.
- Make Generator Ctx the same as parser Ctx
- Add in Generator operations for deleting attribute, element, swapping two
  elements, modifying the prologue, changing name/comment/text of an element
- Add a procedure Check that parses the DTD, and checks the tree versus DTD.

No change of Xml_Parser API at all.
