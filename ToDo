* Move Xml_Generator as a child package of Xml_Parser
Add it a function Init_From_Parsed (Ctx : Ctx_Type) return Xml_Dscr_Type;
(move the code from Xml_Checker) and use it in Xml_Checker. Add checks that
then the tree of elements can be modified, but not the prologue nor the root.
Add operations for moving to child or brother, deleting attribute, child
or brother, swapping two elements.
Add a procedure Check that parses the DTD if needed (if not init from parsed),
and checks the tree versus DTD.

No change of Xml_Parser at all.
