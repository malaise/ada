A package that parses arguments.
It allows keys to be set by "-f" or by "--flag",
by "-o set" or by "--option=set".
Single letter keys can be grouped, like "-of"

The restricionts on arguments are:
- a space as argument is forbidden (and detected).
- when grouped, single char keys cannot have options. So, if "-o/--option"
can have an option, then in case of "-ao" it has no option.

As input it takes an array of records, each with:
- a char key (possibly space)
- a Ustr (Ada.Strings.Unbounded) key (possibly Nus)
- A boolean indicating if it can have an option when on one char

As output it returns a private object that supports the operations:
-- Index is relative to the array provided as input
-- Nb of occurence of the key, possibly 0
function Get_Nb_Occurences (Index : Positive) return Natural;
-- Absolute position of an occurence, possibly 0
function Get_Position (Index : Positive; Occurence : Positive);
