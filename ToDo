+ Move Xml_Generator as a child package of Xml_Parser
+ Add it a function Init_From_Parsed (Ctx : Ctx_Type) return Xml_Dscr_Type;
  (move the code from Xml_Checker) and use it in Xml_Checker. Add checks that
  then the tree of elements can be modified, but not the prologue nor the root.
+ Make Generator Ctx the same as parser Ctx
+ Check/Set parsing status in Xml_Generator operations
+ Continue with Set doctype
+ Add a Get_Pi in Xml_Parser, store the Pi in the Attribute, no more text child
  of an element
+ In Gen add a flag Append_Next to the Add_xxx of prologue
+ in Gen check that adding an element inits the prologue & Root
+ Add in Generator operations for deleting attribute, element,
  modifying the prologue, changing name/comment/text of an element
- Add in Generator a procedure to swap 2 elements
- Add a procedure Check that parses the DTD, and checks the tree versus DTD

No change of Xml_Parser API (except PI).
