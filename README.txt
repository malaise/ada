Ada notes
=========

This README file describes briefly the main directories of the Ada contrib.

The software compiles with Ada 2012 (Gnat GPL 2012) and runs on Unix (Linux).

Some programs depend on anchor:XPCRE[] PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) and work
with version 7.8 or above (8.21 is OK) and require the PCRE developpement
package.

The 'asciidoc' suite is used for the generation of the documentation.

The graphical library is based on X11 and needs:

* the X11 developpement package,
* the font packages 75dpi and 100dpi and the corresponding transcoded (from
  ISO 10646-1) versions.

Finally, a C libray needs the lib gdbm developpement package.

NOTE: Some C includes and libraries are installed in '/usr/local'. The first
time, you may need to install them as root then change their owner.
You may also need to add '/usr/local/lib' in '/etc/ld.so.conf' (and do a
'ldconfig').

Programs are rated from 1 (simple) to 3 (very complex), on subjective
criteria.

Gnatmake (optional)
-------------------
The script 'ada/gnatmake' can be set in the PATH (you can copy it or make a link
from '$HOME/bin/gnatmake' to it).

Similarly, the commands 'ada' and 'gnatlink' can be in the path and be this
same gnatmake script (you can copy it or make links from '$HOME/bin/ada' and
'$HOME/bin/gnatlink' to it).

Automatic generation by make (see next section) doesn't use them but these
scripts are convenient for manual compilation.

Makefiles project (MANDATORY)
-----------------------------
This project gathers several generic definitions for C and Ada generation.
Several examples of usage can be found in the source directories.

Relocation of the Makefiles directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the Makefiles installation directory is not '$(HOME)/Makefiles', then the
new location can be set must be set in the environment variable 'MAKFILES_DIR'. Otherwise:

- the definition of 'TEMPLATES' in 'common.mk' has to be adapted,

- all makefiles must have their first include directive of 'common.mk' adapted
with the new location.

Relocation of C or Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the 'c' or the 'repository' directory is not in '$(HOME)/ada', then the
template 'path.mk' of Makefiles must be adapted with the new path.

Recursive make
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The content of the makefile for applying make to subdirectories is:

  SUBDIRS := c reposit usr
  include $(HOME)/Makefiles/dir.mk

Other directives can be added if something has also to be compiled in current
dir.

C directory (MANDATORY)
-----------------------
Four libraries are generated here:

.C utilities ('cutil')
This lib gathers several low level utility libraries:

- 'timeval', used by other C libraries, for struct timeval operations,

- 'socket', interfaced by the Ada 'Socket' package, interfaces socket calls
(tcp, udp, ipm, message on tcp, afinet or afux),

- 'sys_calls', interfaced by the Ada 'Sys_Calls' and some other Ada packages,
for several operating system calls,

- 'wait_evt', interfaced by the Ada "Even_Mng" package, waits (with "select") on
several fds, catches signals...

.X11 management ('xmng')
This lib encapsulates all the needed calls to X11, interfaced by the Ada 'X_Mng'
package.

.Ndbm ('cnbdbm')
This lib interfaces with ndbm C library. The corresponding Ada 'Ndbm' package is
not used at present (except in test).

.Posix to PCRE ('posic2pcre')
Own binding of xref:XPCRE[PCRE] to POSIX API, with extension, interfaced by
the Ada 'Regular_Expressions' package.

Reposit directory
-----------------
There are many utility packages here.
Some of them are interdependant, the main dependency trees are:

- Graphic (X11) function: 'X_Mng' <- 'Con_Io' <- 'Afpx' and 'Curve'

- Communication, Timers: 'Socket', 'Timers' and 'Event_Mng' <- 'Tcp_Util' <-
'Autobus' (and 'Channels')

See link:reposit/REPOSIT_LIST.html[] for the list of packages and how to use
them.

Usr directories
---------------
Each directory under 'usr' hosts a standalone project, except 'misc'
(miscellaneous small programs), 'tests' (test programs of repository packages)
and 'tasks' (simple task examples).

They all depend on C and Reposit and are independant from the others (except
'pipe' -> 'fifos' -> 'dictio').

The more usefull are 'udp_spy' and 'xml_checker' (in directory 'misc'), 'agite',
'alook', 'als', 'asubst', 'lsadeps' and 'mcd'.

The games are 'g' (in directory 'misc'), 'battleship', 'lem', 'mmind', 'nimmari' and
'sokoban'.

Here is the full list and description, rated from 1 (simple) to 3 (very
complex) on subjective criteria:

Account (3)::
     Based on 'Afpx', this tool handles the management of bank accounts, with
     cheque, credit card (defered) and transfer operations.

Agite (3)::
     GUI for Git on 'Afpx', directory oriented. Access to history and external
     diff tool.

Als (2)::
     Lists, more or less the "ls" way, files and directories. Allow selection
     by date, type, regexp. Allows merging of all outputs and sorting.

Approx (3)::
     Using 'Afpx' and 'Curve', the program computes and displays the
     polynomial approximation of a set of points in the plan.

Astub (3)::
     Ada05 stubber (makes compilable empty body from spec).

Asubst (3)::
     Substitutes in files the strings matching a regexp by new strings.

Battleship (2)::
     Battleship game for two players through the network (with 'Autobus').

Chess (3)::
     With 'Con_Io' and 'Tcp_Util', allows two players to play chess on one or
     two displays. Checks movement validity (already tricky) but does not play
     against human (too tricky).

C_Magic (1)::
     Small program that computes magic squares (numbers from to 1 in a
     square, with same sum on all rows, cols and diags). Consumes a lot of
     CPU despite many optims :-)

Code (1)::
     Simple programs that codes (crypts) and decodes a text. The crypting algo
     are old and not secure.

Day_Of_Week (1)::
     Simple program that tells everything on today (or on another day).

Dictio (3)::
     Distributed data dictionnary that allows storing data, distributing this
     data base on all the machines. Ensures correct insertion of new machines
     and periodic consistency checks. Recovery of data loss may be optimized
     (presently it resends all).

Enigma (2)::
     Encodes/decodes text like german enigma machines did in ww2.

Fifos (2)::
     Use 'dictio' to make distributed point to point connections (logical
     adress, automatic connection and re-connection). Deprecated, use
     'Autobus' instead.

Fl (1)::
     Simple computation of fligh log (adding hours and minutes).

Great_Circle (1)::
     Computation of heading and distance between two points on earth (GPS).

Heart (3)::
     Dta base of heart rate measures, displayed with 'Afpx'.

Hungar (2)::
     Euristic search (hungarian method) of best affection (e.g. of people to
     jobs). Tough algo.

Lem (2)::
     Game: land the LEM on the moon.

Lsadeps (2)::
     Shows the list/tree of Ada units/files dependencies.

Mcd (3)::
     Reverse polish computer. At command line level but very powerful.

Misc::
     Many simple programs here. The most interesting are:
- Alook (1) properly formats the words of a (valid) Ada05 source file.
- Dtd_Checker (1) checks a DTD file (of a xml).
- G (1) is a game where to find the remaining of division by 3.
- Prime (1) searches prime numbers.
- Renamer (1) is a 'Afpx' based HMI to rename files.
- Stat (1) counts the number of instruction of (valid) Ada source files.
- Status (1) evaluates if a target file needs to be rebuilt.
- Tcping (1) pings in tcp a host:port.
- Tcp_spy (1) accepts a TCP connection and dumps data received on it.
- Trail_spaces (1) removes tabs and trailing spaces and dos2unix a file.
- Udp_Spy (2) displays udp/ipm packets received on a port.
- Wake (1) sends a "Wake On LAN" packet on the local network or to a host:port.
- Xml_Checker (3) checks and formats a XML file.

Mmind (2)::
     Mastermind game on 'Con_Io'.

Navig (2)::
     Navigation computation (wind, speed, heading, route, drift...).

Nimmari (2)::
     Nim and Marienbad game on 'Afpx'.

Pexec (1)::
     Recursive execution on directories of commands.

Pipe (1)::
     Uses Fifo to relay stdin to another host where another pipe can put it on
     stdout. Deprecated, use 'tcpipe' and 't_async'.

Renardeau (2)::
     Computes a target number by combining base numbers.

Simusi (2)::
     Machining simulation. (Tough algo).

Sokoban (2)::
     The famous Sokoban game (push the boxes).

Tasks::
     Several simple programs using tasks.

Tcpchat (3)::
     Accepts connection of a TCP port, expects sentences and executes
     specified actions depending on what it receives.

Tcpipe (2)::
     As a bridge, multiplexes and relays TCP connections.

Tests::
     Several small test programs of the Repository packages.

Xwords (2)::
     A graphical lexicography of common words and nouns (french DB),
     search with wildcards for crosswords, search of anagrams.

Cots directories
----------------

This directory mainly contains a copy of:

- pragmarc and mine from http://pragmada.home.mchsi.com (under GPL)

- LinXtris from http://sourceforge.net/projects/linxtris (under GPL)

They use Gtk-Ada 2.1x.

Testing
-------
The directory 'tests' contains many tests of the packages of the 'repository'.
It contains a 'Test' scripts that runs automatic tests and stops on error if
a test fails. With option '-ix' the 'Test' script launches the tests of the
packages that are based on X11 ('X_Mng', 'Con_Io', 'Afpx', 'Curve'...)
for interactive testing.

Many projects in 'usr' subdirectories also implement automatic tests that are
launched by a local 'Test' script and fail on error.

Finally a 'Test' script in 'usr' lauches all the tests, which takes around 5
minutes.
